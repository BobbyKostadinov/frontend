In reality, Spike Island was an isolated field near Widnes, edged by stubby trees, pylons and a lurid green creek – as an island it was certainly more Canvey than Crete.

Stone Roses' tour manager <strong>Steve Adge</strong> recalls the band's era-defining gig at Spike Island in Widnes.</p>","body":"<p>A lot has been said about Spike Island, but I only have fond memories of the event. I picked the band up late afternoon in Manchester and drove them across to the venue. It was really hot, and most of the fans had been there since the morning. We used to bring ice pops to gigs and hand them out to everyone to cool them down, and they went down well that day.</p> <p>As we arrived there was a little bridge you had to drive over. Supposedly, there were frogmen in the water in case any ravers fell in. There were masses of kids hanging outside the backstage area without tickets and when the band saw them they gave me all their guest tickets and I handed them out to the kids saying, &apos;That&apos;s a present from the band. Enjoy yourself.&apos; Then I went to the front of Spike Island, where kids without tickets were trying to scale the fence, and sorted as many of them out as I could in true Roses fashion.</p> <p>My other favourite memory of the day is the huge inflatable globe I bought for Ian Brown.</p> <p>I blew it up, gave it him and he said: &apos;What&apos;s that?&apos; &apos;Just hold it in your hand,&apos; I said, &apos;and all the journalists next week will be saying you&apos;ve got the whole world in your hand.&apos; And they did. The band came on just as the sun was setting, and they were amazing.</p> <p>I know some people have said there was a problem with chemicals in the air because the gig was next to a chemical plant, but I only know of a couple of people who were there who now have six fingers.</p> <p><strong>In other news ...</strong></p> <p><strong>Killing Time</strong></p> <p>Adamski goes to number one with &apos;Killer&apos; on 6 May and remains there throughout the month. The track makes a household name of stadium soul exponent Seal, who later releases another version produced by Trevor Horn.</p> <p><strong>Stroke of luck</strong></p> <p>Toronto police threaten to arrest Madonna on 29 May if she performs her infamous simulated masturbation scene during &apos;Like a Virgin&apos; on her &apos;Blond Ambition&apos; tour. Madge refuses to change her show, and the police decide not to press charges.</p> <p><strong>The bitterest spill</strong></p> <p>Australian band Midnight Oil perform a concert outside Exxon&apos;s offices in New York City, on 30 May, in front of a banner that reads &apos;Midnight Oil Makes You Dance, Exxon Oil Makes Us Sick&apos;, in protest at the Valdez oil spill.</p>","linkText":"Flashback,

Eighteen years after singer and&nbsp;guitarist Bjelland, bass-player Maureen Herman and drummer Lori Barbero last toured together, Babes in Toyland are no less shocking, combative or thrillingly alive.</p><p>The tight, solid three-piece have distanced themselves from the messy rancour that accompanied BiT’s demise in 2001 and returned to the heady days of punishing, proto-riot grrrl punk when this, the second incarnation of BiT, successfully took on the grunge boys at their own game and unleashed a howl of uncontrite female rage that still reverberates today. True to her role as the co-creator – with frenemy Courtney Love – of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinderwhore\" title=\"\">kinderwhore fashion</a>, Bjelland is a fragile figure in a delicate minidress, her black hair teased into a precarious bird’s nest. But&nbsp;the moment the stomping rhythm and attacking chords of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHJbB9Qmjek\" title=\"\">He’s My Thing</a> burst into life, Bjelland’s eyes stare manically,

As the crowd of the Electric Ballroom await her arrival, the usual anticipation is tinged with disbelief: having seen <a href=\"http://www.thepunksinger.com/\" title=\"\">The Punk Singer</a> – the documentary about her in which she talks candidly about her illness – and had our tickets refunded for the Julie Ruin’s cancelled 2014 tour, many of us present tonight thought she wouldn’t come back.</p> <p>This matters because <a href=\"http://www.collapseboard.com/features/interviews/the-original-transcript-of-the-guardian-kathleen-hanna-interview/\" title=\"\">for more than two decades Hanna has been an iconic figure</a>, a loud-and-proud feminist who, with her punk band Bikini Kill and dancier outfit Le Tigre, has melded pop and politics with galvanising deftness. She does it again with the Julie Ruin: stage banter during the hour-long set runs the gamut from Ireland’s marriage referendum to abortion rights, the drought in California and gender essentialism. But whereas in Bikini Kill, Hanna did most of the talking, here she has a sparring partner: Kenny Mellman, previously the latter half of cabaret duo <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiki_and_Herb\" title=\"\">Kiki and Herb</a>. Pretending to be chat-show hosts and skitting each other’s stage outfits, Hanna and Mellman make a scintilliating comedy duo themselves, the affection between them palpable.</p> <p>It’s just as well they talk politics between songs, because almost every word Hanna sings is indistinguishable amid the clang and clatter of Mellman’s popcorn keyboards and Kathi Willcox’s space-hopper basslines. The Julie Ruin are a playground translated into sound: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEltsPb8M6Q\" title=\"\">Oh Come On</a> has the angularity of a climbing frame, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjkxuSfUDjI\" title=\"\">South Coast Plaza</a> the spin and swirl of a merry-go-round, and every song makes you want to trampoline. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydo4VS87hBE\" title=\"\">Run Fast</a>, the title track from their 2013 album, is oddly downbeat for an encore but, dealing with the multitude of ways young women are belittled, it argues the need for accessible feminism exquisitely.</p>","linkText":"The Julie Ruin review – Kathleen Hanna fronts a playground translated into

Now the Nottingham rapper immortalised in the Shane Meadows film is back with his first album, Aeon","body":"<p>“I was a chubby white kid who wasn’t very cool at school,” says <a href=\"http://www.scorzilla.com/aeon-peace-to-the-puzzle/\">Scor-zay-zee</a>. “I took up rapping because I wanted to be cool.” For one fleeting moment in 2004, the underground Nottingham rapper became exactly that: the most talked-about man in music. His incendiary, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3XCSlTXFk\">anti-establishment track Great Britain</a> was picked up by Radio 1, causing such a stir when DJ Zane Lowe played it for the first time that he played it again in the same show. The rightwing press were up in arms that the BBC played it at all. A ferocious attack on the state of Britain, the song compared the Queen to Saddam Hussein and accused the state of conspiring to murder Princess Diana. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1458487/BBC-promotes-rapper-who-claims-the-Royal-Family-killed-Diana.html\">The Telegraph</a> labelled it a “diatribe against the British way of life” and declared it “more offensive than God Save the Queen”. In parliament, MPs called for it to be banned. As record labels scrambled to sign Scor-zay-zee, The Streets’ Mike Skinner offered to work with him.</p><p>But for the song’s maker, whose real name is Dean Palinczuk, the brief burst in the limelight presaged a breakdown not a breakthrough. Raised in the tough Nottingham suburb of St Ann’s, Palinczuk is an unassuming, self-effacing character who had spent eight years grafting a reputation for himself in the hip-hop crew Out Da Ville. But after the furore over Great Britain, he withdrew from music and became disillusioned and depressed. The gulf between the critical acclaim he’d received and the reality of his life widened. “Out there, you’re Scor-zay-zee, getting props,” he said at the time. “But the reality is you’re living at home with your mum, broke, angry, signing on, trying to live up to expectations of what a man should be.”</p>","linkText":"Scor-zay-zee: my battle with cannabis, schizophrenia and very cheap trainers","lastModified":1432721946000,"standfirst":"<p>Vilified in the papers and lambasted in Parliament, Scor-zay-zee exploded into the limelight with his shocking debut single in 2004 – then fell into a downward spiral.

is not, it must be said, a glut of albums born out of improvising from within a 2 million gallon underground water tank.

Perhaps next year, once Cistern’s influence has taken hold, a penchant for subterranean orchestral work will be all the rage. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/dec/20/jherek-bischoff-composed-review\">Jherek Bischoff</a> certainly has a knack for helping his compositions to find a wider audience. Earlier this year, he found acclaim when, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/10/amanda-palmer-interview-you-got-me-singing\">Amanda Palmer</a>, he put out mini tribute album <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/strung-out-in-heaven-bowie/id1081654713\">Strung Out in Heaven</a>, a collection of Bowie songs reconfigured for string quartet. <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/cistern/id1111611693\">Cistern</a> is similarly string-drenched but often conveys a more foreboding atmosphere – one where the echo-laden drums of The Wolf threaten to pummel any briefly escaping melody. Elsewhere, Cistern can be more traditional sounding than its experimental beginnings suggest (perhaps it wasn’t possible to record in the tank) with tracks such as The Sea’s Son relying on simple motifs and grand cinematic sweeps.</p><figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_XgKw1Axrg\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7_XgKw1Axrg?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Watch video for Cistern with Scrape Quartet\n </figcaption> \n</figure>","linkText":"Jherek Bischoff: Cistern review – foreboding and string-drenched","lastModified":1468531883000,"standfirst":"<p>(Leaf)</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4zzcc","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/experimental-music","url":"/music/experimental-music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Experimental music","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/experimental-music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/classicalmusicandopera","url":"/music/classicalmusicandopera","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Classical music","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/classicalmusicandopera","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/popandrock","url":"/music/popandrock","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","url":"/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","tagType":"Tracking","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"UK Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/reviews","url":"/tone/reviews","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/albumreview","url":"/tone/albumreview","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Album reviews","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/albumreview","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/timjonze","url":"/profile/timjonze","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Tim Jonze","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/timjonze","twitterHandle":"timjonze","bio":"<p>Tim Jonze is the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music\">music editor</a> of guardian.co.uk.

In <a href=\"http://epitaph.com/artists/refused\">Freedom</a>, out on 30 June, the youthful exuberance of “full-on anarchist jargon” is gone, and in its place are songs inspired by time spent “talking about politics, existential issues and what we wanted to present as a band in 2015,” says vocalist Dennis Lyxzén. “We talked about the political situation in Europe, capitalism and how it affects people.”</p>","linkText":"Listen to Refused's new track Françafrique","lastModified":1432630805000,"standfirst":"<p>Premiered ahead of new album Freedom, the Swedish punk band ditch anarchist jargon

Phillips is a bit of an outsider, even a solipsist, who writes, produces and performs all of his songs, tracking each instrument himself on an old reel-to-reel.

(2011)</h2><p><strong>Jonathan Richman – I, Jonathan<br></strong>People pick up on the Ramones and the Jesus and Mary Chain in our sound, but Jonathan Richman is someone else who was playing simple, classic, 50s rock’n’roll in his own way. I wasn’t really a big fan before, but I was told to listen to him by someone who had seen a couple of similarities. It legitimised to me the way I was writing songs: he was relying on three chords and melodies we’ve all heard a million times. Party in the USA sounds like something from the Grease soundtrack, but it’s incredibly pure, naive, direct and fun. Lyrically, too, there’s a no-bullshit thing, but there’s also an escapism in all the references to California. The early demos of our first record sound very similar to his songs, because I wrote them all on an acoustic guitar at the end of my bed – though they obviously didn’t end up sounding that way. We never set out to be the most dangerous or unpredictable band – that’s not who we are – and people might be disappointed when they look for that in us.</p>","linkText":"The Vaccines: the music that

Even though you can’t understand the lyrics in about 25% of it (the nonsensical guy yelling is actually a sample from an obscure 1940s recording of prisoners by folk archivist Alan Lomax), the track’s tropical vibes come courtesy of David Guetta and make it the perfect complement to a day at the beach. While Hey Mama was originally released as part of Guetta’s album Listen in November, it smartly wasn’t given traction as a single until the weather started to heat up. There’s no telling if it’ll have the legs to be considered the song of the summer, but one person who’ll be watching closely is pop songstress Bebe Rexha. While her vocals sound indistinguishable from Minaj’s, Rexha is actually the one belting out the chorus (“Banging the drum like dum-diddy-day, I like the dirty rhythm you play”), but perplexingly went uncredited. Dirty rhythm, indeed! <strong><em>RLD</em></strong></p>","linkText":"Summer jams: Guardian critics pick the songs that will soundtrack your holidays","lastModified":1432318379000,"standfirst":"<p>As the perennial debate begins over which songs will own the summer, our critics chime in with their favourites – and find mobile phones, yoga and polyamorous relationships are the big themes this year</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/494kh","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/popandrock","url":"/music/popandrock","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/nicki-minaj","url":"/music/nicki-minaj","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Nicki Minaj","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/nicki-minaj","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/janelle-monae","url":"/music/janelle-monae","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Janelle Monae","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/janelle-monae","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/david-guetta","url":"/music/david-guetta","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"David Guetta","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/david-guetta","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/features","url":"/tone/features","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Features","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/rob-le-donne","url":"/profile/rob-le-donne","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Rob LeDonne","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rob-le-donne","twitterHandle":"robledonne","bio":"<p>Rob LeDonne is a freelance journalist and comedy writer.</p>","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/kate-hutchinson","url":"/profile/kate-hutchinson","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Kate Hutchinson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kate-hutchinson","twitterHandle":"katehutchinson","bio":"<p>Kate Hutchinson is deputy editor of the Guide.

As well as co-penning the excellent Yo Yo and Little Nikki Says for, well, Little Nikki, she has also worked on songs for Leona Lewis and Bridgit Mendler. Apparently it took a slightly drunken chat with her mum for her to realise that she had her own things to say as an artist, hence debut single My Kinda Swag, premiered here. Having been offered various record deals, she decided she “quite fancied the opportunity to hold up this first piece of pie to the world and say, ‘Look what I made, this is me.’” So what does My Kinda Swag have to say for itself? Well, that title isn’t an indication of what follows. Anyone expecting a Cher Lloyd-style heavy-handed brag-fest is in for a surprise: the theme is “a loving reminder that your worth as a human being is measured by who and what you are”. Built around a simple piano figure, it starts like a delicate torch song, before a metronomic electronic pulse cocoons the first verse tightly. Then the whole thing cracks open with the song’s almighty chorus (and that delicious post-chorus bit where she sings, “I like the kind of people that you roll with” is one of the highlights of 2015 so far).<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p>","linkText":"The playlist: pop – Emmi, Little Mix, PYCO and more","lastModified":1432309754000,"standfirst":"<p>A cracking debut from Emmi, a call to arms from PYCO, plus Little Mix explore the breezier side of black magic</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4962p","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/series/the-playlist","url":"/music/series/the-playlist","tagType":"Series","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"The playlist","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/series/the-playlist","description":"Our team of experts curate bespoke playlists for different forms of music from around the world","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/popandrock","url":"/music/popandrock","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/series/listen-up","url":"/music/series/listen-up","tagType":"Series","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Listen up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/series/listen-up","description":"Hear album streams, watch videos and discover the best new music\r\n","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/blog","url":"/tone/blog","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Blogposts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/michaelcragg","url":"/profile/michaelcragg","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Michael Cragg","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michaelcragg","bio":"<p>Michael Cragg is features editor at <a href=\"http://popjustice.com/\">popjustice.com</a> and writes a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/series/new-music\">daily New Music blog</a> for The Guardian.

are becoming aware of this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/09/selected-poems-frank-ohara-review\">Frank O’Hara </a>classic. I hear people talking about him when the fearful topic of poetry arises. I have a great belief that poetry should not be talked about. It is something too sacred to be ruined by conversation. I think, like a god, it should be prayed over in private. The Americans had a very enviable ability during the last century to reinvent themselves and make great leaps of modernism in the arts. The reasons for this are probably pretty obvious. But this new conversational and direct style of writing did away with old-fashioned romantic language and high sentiment. Everyone was now a poet. It was the culmination of Whitman, Céline and Robert Lowell and would lead the way for <a href=\"http://milan-poetry.blogspot.co.uk/2007/03/laughing-heart-charles-bukowski.html\">Bukowski</a> to rear his dirty head. Writing like this was tantamount to a revolutionary act. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jackkerouac\">Jack Kerouac</a> famously heckled O’Hara during one of his readings shouting: “You’re killing poetry, O’Hara.” To which Frank replied: “Well, that’s more than you’ve ever done.” Thank God he had the guts to slay the beast once and for all.</p>","linkText":"Money's playlist: Frank

burla!”</em> says Sir John Falstaff. All the world’s a joke. Quite so. The line which kicks off the jolly fugue where, out of mayhem, Verdi creates harmony, seemed even more pertinent than usual. The comic genius of the Italian master’s last great work allowed the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra’s annual opera in concert to proceed in the highest of end-of-term spirits, marking the close of the CBSO’s Our Shakespeare season. Having marshalled a first-class cast, and in dynamic form on the podium, it was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.askonasholt.co.uk/artists/conductors/edward-gardner\">Edward Gardner</a>, in his final appearance as the orchestra’s principal guest conductor, who masterminded the occasion, sparky and sparkling from beginning to life-affirming final chord.</p><p>In the title role was <a href=\"http://www.ambrogiomaestri.com\">Ambrogio Maestri</a>, with girth to match his vocal might, and whose authoritative assumption of the fat knight’s persona is internationally acclaimed. Maestri, every bit as magisterial as his name, extrapolated every ounce, no, every gram, of comic possibility from the music, varying his sound from big, booming resonance to mischievous falsetto and bringing lovely variety to the colouring.</p>","linkText":"CBSO/Gardner: Falstaff review – played in the highest of end-of-term spirits","lastModified":1468530020000,"standfirst":"<p><strong>Symphony

Quartet</a>, is an unusual and timely one. Scored for tenor and string quartet, it sets English translations by Anne-Marie McManus of text from the Syrian poet <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2014/08/29/ursula-lindsey/syria-speaks/\">Ali Safar</a>’s A Black Cloud in a Leaden White Sky, or Death by Stabs of Sorrow.<br></p><p>Safar and McManus have distilled elements of the tragic Syrian experience into words that are simple, direct and without any hint of rhetoric or sensation.

that year this is the 400th anniversary of William Shakespeare’s death, it is a less well celebrated fact that 2016 also marks the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/mar/30/500-years-venetian-ghetto-jewish-italian-history\">500th year since the establishment of the Venetian ghetto</a>. The highlight of the first weekend of the York Early Music festival was an eclectic programme by the Italian-Jewish group <a href=\"http://www.lucidarium.com/progetto3/\">Ensemble Lucidarium</a>, which aimed to recreate the sounds of Shylock’s Venice. Admittedly these sounds were based on scholarly guesswork, as traditional Hebraic melodies were transmitted orally and rarely written down. And whatever instruments Jewish musicians had access to in the ghetto, it seems highly improbable that the Swedish <a href=\"http://www.nyckelharpa.org/about/what-is-a-nyckelharpa/\">nyckelharpa</a> was among them – though Elodie Poirier played this curious hybrid between a cello and a typewriter with remarkable eloquence.</p><p> Diego Pisador’s depiction of Pharaoh’s dream, written 400 years before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/dec/11/joseph-amazing-technicolor-dreamcoat-andrew-lloyd-webber-film\">Andrew Lloyd Webber’s setting of the same subject</a>, runs to extraordinary length; though Lior Leibovici’s delivery of a dozen stanzas was so captivating one would have gladly listened to the other 290 as well. The ensemble donned sinister carnival masks for the unflattering madrigal portrait of the nymph Ebraica with her “big cow eyes and flat pug nose”. And the ebullient raconteur Enrico Fink added spoken-word segments, including an entry from the records of the Venetian Inquisition concerning a Jew named Aaron who, on discovering there was a financial incentive to becoming baptised, got himself baptised in six different cities. </p>","linkText":"York Early Music Festival review – eclectic and

Pascoal throws everything into his party – from kettles to bird-squawks – as his band and hand-picked orchestra deliver a scintillating free-jazz furore","body":"<p>With the multi-instrumental virtuosity that embraces keyboards, flutes, tea-kettles, bird-squawks and body-percussion, his creativity as sharp as ever, and so much white hair cascading down his back and his barrel chest that it isn’t always apparent which way round he’s facing, the Brazilian composer-player Hermeto Pascoal remains one of the most unmissable performers in contemporary music. For his 80th birthday celebration in London, Pascoal once again combined the forces of his formidable Brazilian road-band with a hand-picked British orchestra. At the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/nov/21/hermeto-pascoal-review\">Barbican in 2011</a>, this setup hadn’t entirely gelled, but it was a different story on this exhilarating show, particularly in the second half.</p><p>After the fine 19-piece British band opened with the dissonantly lyrical fanfare Apresentaçao under composer, producer and trumpeter <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.noellangley.co.uk/\">Noel Langley’s</a> direction, Pascoal materialised, but in the stalls rather than on stage, swapping vocal licks with the audience that began with lullaby-like lilts and ended on maniacal cackles. He switched to a solo piano meditation of contrastingly Keith Jarrett-like elegance, but ended it in acerbic bird-calls, Julian Siegel on tenor sax and Henry Lowther on trumpet inventively negotiating the dense harmonic foliage of Viva Gil Evans with the orchestra. Pascoal’s group then launched the first of a sequence of fast Brazilian-bop themes (breathless displays that were visited a little too frequently in the first half), in which singer Aline Morena would scat-duet in dizzying unison with saxophonist Jota P Ramos. The borders between the two ensembles began to blur, with a free-jazz furore of slamming riffs from the orchestra arriving on the heels of a dramatic drum solo from the Brazilian Ajurina Zwarg, UK drummer Mark Mondesir stoking up the momentum and a ferment of Brazilian dance rhythms from the samba and forro traditions erupting on all manner of percussion.</p>","linkText":"Hermeto Pascoal review – Brazilian's 80th birthday brings many happy returns","lastModified":1468261966000,"standfirst":"<p><strong>Barbican, London<br></strong>Hermeto Pascoal throws everything into his party – from kettles to bird-squawks – as his band and hand-picked orchestra deliver a scintillating free-jazz furore</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4zhef","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/jazz","url":"/music/jazz","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Jazz","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/jazz","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","url":"/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","tagType":"Tracking","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"UK Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/reviews","url":"/tone/reviews","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/livereview","url":"/tone/livereview","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Live music reviews","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/livereview","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/johnfordham","url":"/profile/johnfordham","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"John Fordham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/johnfordham","bio":"<p>John Fordham is the Guardian's main jazz critic.

is not, it must be said, a glut of albums born out of improvising from within a 2 million gallon underground water tank. At least not yet. Perhaps next year, once Cistern’s influence has taken hold, a penchant for subterranean orchestral work will be all the rage. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/dec/20/jherek-bischoff-composed-review\">Jherek Bischoff</a> certainly has a knack for helping his compositions to find a wider audience. Earlier this year, he found acclaim when, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/10/amanda-palmer-interview-you-got-me-singing\">Amanda Palmer</a>, he put out mini tribute album <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/strung-out-in-heaven-bowie/id1081654713\">Strung Out in Heaven</a>, a collection of Bowie songs reconfigured for string quartet. <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/cistern/id1111611693\">Cistern</a> is similarly string-drenched but often conveys a more foreboding atmosphere – one where the echo-laden drums of The Wolf threaten to pummel any briefly escaping melody. Elsewhere, Cistern can be more traditional sounding than its experimental beginnings suggest (perhaps it wasn’t possible to record in the tank) with tracks such as The Sea’s Son relying on simple motifs and grand cinematic sweeps.</p><figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_XgKw1Axrg\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7_XgKw1Axrg?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Watch video for Cistern with Scrape Quartet\n </figcaption> \n</figure>","linkText":"Jherek Bischoff: Cistern review – foreboding and string-drenched","lastModified":1468531883000,"standfirst":"<p>(Leaf)</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4zzcc","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/experimental-music","url":"/music/experimental-music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Experimental music","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/experimental-music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/classicalmusicandopera","url":"/music/classicalmusicandopera","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Classical music","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/classicalmusicandopera","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/popandrock","url":"/music/popandrock","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","url":"/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","tagType":"Tracking","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"UK Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/reviews","url":"/tone/reviews","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/albumreview","url":"/tone/albumreview","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Album reviews","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/albumreview","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/timjonze","url":"/profile/timjonze","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Tim Jonze","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/timjonze","twitterHandle":"timjonze","bio":"<p>Tim Jonze is the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music\">music editor</a> of guardian.co.uk.

href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/mar/15/cult-heroes-fountains-of-wayne-slacker-songsmiths-with-a-knack-for-melody\">Fountains of Wayne</a>, alongside Adam Schlesinger. Second, he also insists he threw out every song that sounded like it might be by Fountains of Wayne. In both cases, he’s being a little disingenuous: he writes and sings every song, aided by a rhythm section, and whatever his intentions, it will be perceived as a solo record. And, sonically, it’s not a million miles from the last FoW record, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jul/28/fountains-of-wayne-sky-holes-review\">Sky Full of Holes</a>, which was similarly light on power chords. The lead single, Aeroplane, could be from that album: “Making a lane from the gate to the plane / Do you think I could just crash here?” is the kind of opening line we’ve heard so often from Collingwood. What’s different is that he’s eschewed the snarky character studies of his other band, in favour of seemingly more heartfelt songs, in which cynicism is displaced by wistfulness – Minor Is the Lonely Key, as one especially lovely song puts it. Look Park is understated to the point of diffidence, but recommended for those who favour the song over the sonics. </p>","linkText":"Look Park: Look Park review – heartfelt Fountains of Wayne

artist</a>, but he’s not the only one thriving without record label support. Rod Thomas, the Welsh disco doyen who records under the moniker Bright Light Bright Light, has assembled a murderers’ row of guest artists on his self-released third album Choreography – including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/03/alan-cumming-interview-look-ridiculous\">Alan Cumming</a>, two of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/scissor-sisters\">Scissor Sisters</a> and his long-term mentor figure Elton John – and all without an exec in sight. Then again, Choreography doesn’t exactly resemble the work of a DIY artist. Inspired by the sheen and optimism of movies of the 1980s, it’s a lavish and maximalist affair, full of wistful, heartfelt pop songs. With its brassy synths, opener All in the Name wouldn’t feel out of place in the closing credits of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/nov/27/why-working-girl-offers-the-real-deal-mike-nichols-melanie-griffith\">Working Girl</a>, while Careful Whisper, title nod onwards, evokes the sleeves-up era of the new romantics. All of this is done with immense skill, with every element sounding painstakingly honed to evoke maximum resonance for those of a certain age. Yet at times it feels just a little too on the nose, more a lovingly recreated period piece than something adventurous and new.</p><figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inoNKupmGl4\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/inoNKupmGl4?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure>","linkText":"Bright Light Bright Light: Choreography review – a 1980s disco recreated with love","lastModified":1468530013000,"standfirst":"<p>(Self-released)</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4zpad","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/popandrock","url":"/music/popandrock","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","url":"/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","tagType":"Tracking","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"UK Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/albumreview","url":"/tone/albumreview","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Album reviews","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/albumreview","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/reviews","url":"/tone/reviews","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/gwilym-mumford","url":"/profile/gwilym-mumford","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Gwilym Mumford","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/gwilym-mumford","bio":"<p>Gwilym Mumford is assistant editor of the Guardian Guide.

They are a nine-piece, playing trumpets, trombones, saxophones and sousaphone, but to this they add percussion, including drum machines, and electronica. They have collaborated with singers, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/31/amy-dvd-review\">Amy Winehouse</a>, but this is an instrumental set in which they show off their range and expertise. The best self-composed tracks include trumpeter Steve Pretty’s Reawake, with its shift between a drifting, atmospheric opening, insistent rhythm patterns and grand finale, and Luke Christie’s jaunty It’s Normally Bigger. Then there are rock-influenced pieces, including a drifting treatment of Kurt Cobain’s Heart Shaped Box and a frantic and furious reworking of Three Trapped Tigers’ Cramm.

The songs include the celebratory <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9altdFM4NI\">I Am African</a>, and a reminder of her proud history, Calypso Queen. And there’s a new version of her 1970s protest No Madame, which led to government intervention to stop the exploitation of domestic servants. A glorious summer album. </p><figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9altdFM4NI\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/K9altdFM4NI?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Listen to I Am African by Calypso Rose\n </figcaption> \n</figure>","linkText":"Calypso Rose: Far from Home review – a glorious summer album","lastModified":1468530014000,"standfirst":"<p>(Because Music) </p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4zzgz","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/worldmusic","url":"/music/worldmusic","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"World music","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/worldmusic","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","url":"/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","tagType":"Tracking","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"UK Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/reviews","url":"/tone/reviews","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/albumreview","url":"/tone/albumreview","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Album reviews","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/albumreview","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/robindenselow","url":"/profile/robindenselow","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Robin Denselow","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/robindenselow","bio":"<p>Robin Denselow, the Guardian's world and folk critic, is a journalist and broadcaster who specialises in both music and politics.

obsessed with improvising jazz – he plays vocal-toned, riff-driven soul and funk. But he does it with power and a poetic poignancy creatively drawn from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/apr/09/david-sanborn-time-and-the-river-review\">David Sanborn</a> and Eddie Cleanhead Vinson – qualities noted by fellow Bristolian saxophonist <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/05/carla-bley-andy-sheppard-steve-swallow-andando-el-tiempo-review\">Andy Sheppard</a>, who has been a mentor for Morton and guests on one track here. Former James Brown sidemen Pee Wee Ellis and trombonist Fred Wesley effusively power up The Kid’s generic but very lively tracklist of gospel anthems, pumping Crusaders-like dance themes and beseeching James Brownian soul wailers, and local guitarist Denny Ilett catches the irresistibly choppy rhythm-guitar vibe just right. Since this is licks-oriented music, there’s a limited jazz appeal, but Sheppard’s leisurely conversation with Morton on the sunny and laid-back If They Only Knew is delicious, and the leader’s slow and bluesy finale Trouble – with a humming Hammond organ beneath and an unexpected violin payoff – suggests the pacing and dynamics of this set could have been varied a little more without diminishing its considerable sparkle.</p>","linkText":"James Morton: The Kid review – soul and funk with sparkle","lastModified":1468517501000,"standfirst":"<p>(Matusik Records) </p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4zz92","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/jazz","url":"/music/jazz","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Jazz","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/jazz","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/reviews","url":"/tone/reviews","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/albumreview","url":"/tone/albumreview","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Album reviews","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/albumreview","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","url":"/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","tagType":"Tracking","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"UK Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/johnfordham","url":"/profile/johnfordham","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"John Fordham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/johnfordham","bio":"<p>John Fordham is the Guardian's main jazz critic.

Thursday night’s show at the Lexington in London was rapturous, and Simon Raymonde of Bella Union was so entranced by his label’s new signing that he went slightly berserk on Instagram on his way home from the show.</p>","linkText":"Why Ezra Furman is the most compelling live act you can see right now","lastModified":1432306641000,"standfirst":"<p>The Chicagoan singer is the kind of performer who

Jamaica, no one can hear you scream ‘bad taste’, which is why you are as likely to hear schlocky soft rock on a sound system as the island’s dancehall stars","body":"<p>It is 2am on Tuesday at a mechanic’s shop in Kingston, Jamaica. The car park is full of people. Speaker stacks tower in each corner and dancehall fills the air. Suddenly, the sound system cuts and the selector announces that he is going to play a song – one of his favourites. After a blast of ray gun and air horn sound effects, the soft piano opening of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNZH-emehxA\">Shania Twain’s You’re Still the One</a> starts up. When it gets to the chorus, the tune gets a rewind, a common response to a crowd-pleaser, even if it is a pop-country ballad from 1998.</p><p>Last year, posters on the streets of Brooklyn, New York, announced the lineup for the Groovin’ in the Park reggae festival. It included classic reggae favourites such as Marcia Griffiths, Judy Mowatt and Bob Andy alongside new-generation roots singer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/11/chronixx-roots-reggae\">Chronixx</a> and lovers rock star Beres Hammond. But the headline act was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWdZEumNRmI\">Aussie soft-rockers Air Supply</a>. On Gawker’s Concourse blog, music critic Andy Beta pondered “<a href=\"http://theconcourse.deadspin.com/big-in-jamaica-why-reggae-fans-inexplicably-love-air-s-1625154716\">why reggae fans mysteriously love Air Supply</a>”. This year, Michael Bolton will top the bill at the Groovin’ in the Park. It shouldn’t come as a surprise – Jamaica has a long and loving relationship with the kind of music that the rest of the world often thinks of as shlocky. In the past few years, Michael Bolton, Air Supply and Celine Dion have all performed on the island.</p>","linkText":"Nice'n'easy listening: why Jamaica loves Celine Dion and Air

href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMCXx5k01Tg\">I Should Be So Lucky</a></h2><p> In the accidentally revisionist wonderland of Spotify, Kylie Minogue’s career begins in 1994: post soap-opera-poppet-turned-pop-star conversion, post Stock, Aitken and Waterman machine music, post Michael Hutchence, post innocence. It forgets the new Olivia Newton John who beamed on to Top of the Pops in January 1988, singing a carefree, breezy song about being unlucky in love and reaching No 1 across Europe with it. Nearly a quarter of a century later, Minogue revisited her first UK chart-topper for an album of jazz reworkings of her back catalogue: an idea that played to the image of her as a filmic, tragic blonde, with mixed results. The slow version of this song sounded majestic, though, tilting its head to the tabloids’ obsession with the narrative of her life – poor Kylie, never married, it’s so sad – but also adding a depth to those lyrics that comes only with age and experience. The original, linked to above, is a bouncy, peppy keeper. The version in our playlist is a heart-melter.</p>","linkText":"Kylie Minogue – 10 of the best","lastModified":1468413188000,"standfirst":"<p>The princess of glitterball pop has stayed lucky for almost 30 years, with irresistibly bouncy floor-fillers and majestic ballads to melt the heart</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4z7h3","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/kylieminogue","url":"/music/kylieminogue","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Kylie Minogue","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/kylieminogue","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/series/10-of-the-best","url":"/music/series/10-of-the-best","tagType":"Series","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"10 of the best","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/series/10-of-the-best","description":"Our weekly guide offering you a quick introduction to the most important artists and genres in pop and rock","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/popandrock","url":"/music/popandrock","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/musicblog","url":"/music/musicblog","tagType":"Blog","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music blog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","url":"/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","tagType":"Tracking","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"UK Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/features","url":"/tone/features","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Features","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/blog","url":"/tone/blog","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Blogposts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/juderogers","url":"/profile/juderogers","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Jude Rogers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/juderogers","bio":"<p>Jude Rogers writes for publications including the Observer, Guardian, New Statesman, Marie Claire and Q.

is, you probably know one of his songs. He was the writer and original performer of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzoazPPC7b8\">none-more-mopey power ballad All By Myself</a>, which reached No 12 in the UK and No 2 in the US in 1976. And if you don’t know his version, you perhaps know <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGrLb6W5YOM\">Céline Dion’s cover from 20 years later</a>, a No 6 hit in Britain and No 4 in the US. If that’s all you know of Carmen, you might be inclined to turn away: All By Myself is Without You’s equally cheerless cousin. Put the two songs side by side and you’ve got a segue to end all hope.</p><p>Carmen has continued to work steadily since, but it’s not his post-smash career we’re interested in here. It’s the four albums he made between 1972 and 1974 fronting Raspberries, the Cleveland group who serve as a cleancut, wholesome mirror to the decadent, self-destructive Big Star, 730 miles away in Memphis. Even now, more than 40 years on, you can find <a href=\"http://ericcarmen.com/forums/index.php?/topic/30396-raspberries-vs-big-staragain/\">powerpop fans arguing</a> about which of the two bands was better. Paul Stanley of Kiss cited both groups as key influences on his band’s early records: “Give me the Raspberries. Give me Small Faces. Give me Big Star.” Big Star’s Alex Chilton recognised a kindred spirit: “I remember when I first heard the Raspberries,” he said. “Big Star were in a van travelling around doing some dates and we heard <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULL7apmAJTE\">Go All the Way</a> on the radio, and we said, ‘Wow, those guys are really doing it!’ I thought that was a great song.”</p>","linkText":"Cult heroes: Raspberries – 60s-loving progenitors of powerpop","lastModified":1468326810000,"standfirst":"<p>Like Big Star, this Cleveland quartet ditched the beard-stroking of

The following day, before heading off to London, I took everyone to meet my mother, Jill, and stepfather, John. Far I was very polite and Fish was in a very bubbly, fun mood.

gentrification and greed transforms London – as well as many of the UK’s other inner cities – one great British institution that has fallen foul has been the nightlife business. In London, the area that has suffered the most is Soho. Once a naughty, massively inspiring little Petri dish from which the likes of David Bowie, the Sex Pistols, Francis Bacon and Lucien Freud emerged, it is being rapidly reshaped into something resembling a homogenised shopping mall. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p><p>One of the first institutions to fall foul of the evisceration of Soho was the Wag, the club Ollie O’Donnell and I founded in 1982 and which ran until 2001. When we began, Soho was really rather seedy and rundown, which was exactly what attracted the young, the groovy and the inventive. The Wag – a nightclub that catered, in the main, to a gang of non-conformist mavericks – was thoroughly appropriate to that crowd. Ollie and I started by packing out the Whisky a Go Go in Wardour Street every Saturday night with our own crowd, then the club’s new leaseholders asked us to run it with them full time. So we lowered the drinks and the door price (which was possible because rents were fair back then), pulled in DJs who played underground music, and the place took off.<br

href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YL8YovVOBpg\">Hitch Hike</a></strong></h2><p>Marvin Pentz Gay Jr’s earliest experiences of singing in public came when he was three, performing as a part of his father’s church choir in Washington DC. With a passion for music that continued into his teenage years sand saw him performing with various groups in DC and then Chicago, he came to the attention of Berry Gordy Jr after moving to Detroit in 1960, and was signed to Tamla, one of Gordy’s Motown imprints. Gaye initially showed no particular desire to become an R&amp;B performer, however, and instead strove to succeed as a jazz musician, perhaps because of his agonising shyness – a trait that was often evident throughout early live performances. He made his first album in 1961, but had to wait until the end of 1962 for his first hit. Hitch Hike was released as a dance song – Gaye recorded the drums and piano himself – showcasing the singer’s soulful vocal range. The song’s composition also clearly influenced other classic songs such as the Velvet Underground’s There She Goes Again, as well as the Smiths’ There is a Light That Never Goes Out.

Now Eno tells <strong>Paul Morley</strong> where he's heading next</p>","body":"<p>When influential music website <em>Pitchfork </em>listed its 100 greatest albums of the 1970s – which in certain other lists is calculated to be the greatest decade for rock music – the modestly immodest, driven, musical non-musician Brian Eno was directly and indirectly involved in at least a quarter of them, including the number one, <em>Low</em>, on which he collaborated with a nomadic, post-\"Fame\" David Bowie and the producer Tony Visconti. As an intellectually mobile loner, scene-setter, systems lover, obstinate rebel, techno-prophet, sensual philosopher, courteous progressive, close listener, gentle heretic, sound planner, adviser explorer, pedant and slick conceptual salesman, and devoted fan of the new, undrab and surprising, wherever it fell between John Cage and Little Richard, or Duchamp and doo wop, or Mondrian and Moog, Eno busily and bossily remodelled pop music during the 70s. He looked at what the Velvet Underground, Can, Steve Reich and the Who had done, went forth and multiplied. Eno created an atmosphere, and helped determine what the history of electronic music was between the avant garde 1950s and the pop 21st century.</p><p>He demonstrated – as an abstract part of the early and surreal Roxy Music, the evocative Bowie Berlin trilogy <em>Heroes/Low/Lodger</em>, the nervy NY Talking Heads, as a floating collaborator with Nico, John Cale, Robert Wyatt, Cluster, Robert Fripp, Kevin Ayers, Jon Hassell and Harold Budd, as stern futurist mentor to Devo and Ultravox, as discerning curator of the beautifully conceived contemporary music label Obscure, as careful discoverer of the pulseless, wordless, eventless, timeless music he lovingly called \"ambient\" – that pop music was where you could be the kind of artist he wanted to be. In 1981, he designed the influential sound and content of <em>My Life in the Bush of Ghosts </em>with David Byrne – the prestigious culmination of his solo and group work in the 1970s, the studio combining of inner space, other worlds, random impressions, scrupulous visions, found sound, taped memories, cut-up text, stolen rhythms, daring edits, painted space, original borrowing, inquisitive permutations, mutant gospel and electronic interference.Then there was U2 and recently, as if relishing the snobbish horror of those who dismiss U2 as pompous irritants, he's attended to another ambitious four-piece male rock group with delusions of splendour, Coldplay, producing their last multi-million selling album and now, at the age of 61, finishing their next. A mischievous ghost of the glammed up art pop star Eno that was first noticed as part of the theatre of Roxy Music now haunts the sound and image of the two biggest rock bands in the world who would claim to be, in fact, post-Eno as much as post-punk. Coldplay didn't really belong anywhere before Eno apart from inside their own success. Now they have attached themselves via Eno to a very particular history of avant pop practice. Eno himself is prone to chuckle good naturedly when faced with bemusement at his connection to Coldplay.</p>","linkText":"On gospel, Abba and the death of the record: an audience with Brian Eno | Interview","lastModified":1263665415000,"standfirst":"He's been a Roxy original, the inventor of 'ambient', Bowie's muse, the brain in Talking Heads and U2's 'fifth man'.

Her mother knew one Beatles song, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46_yYR6tGOI\">I Want to Hold Your Hand</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/beach-boys\">Beach Boys</a> were considered acceptable, but that was pretty much it.

Why have I missed out on hearing this?

Alongside Harry Dean Stanton and Sam Kinison, they were to be guests on Saturday Night Live, the comedy institution that was must-see TV in US households. They were allowed two songs – their single <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6yi30_what-a-mess_music#from=embediframe\">Bastards of Young</a> and <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6yi55_that-s-where-we-re-riding_music#from=embediframe\">Kiss Me on the Bus</a> – both from Tim, their first album since signing to the Warner Brothers imprint, Sire.</p><p>Maybe the band had noted that SNL was having the most disastrous season in its history, and figured their behaviour wouldn’t matter. More likely, they just did what they were wont to do when presented with a golden opportunity: throw it down the toilet, then take a crap on it. The Replacements’ two songs passed in a blur of missed cues, bum notes, stumbling stage moves, appalling clothes, barely off-mic obscenities, and visible and audible drunkenness. They were immediately banned from SNL, and there went another opportunity for the great underachievers of American rock to live up to their talent.</p>","linkText":"The Replacements: ‘God almighty, what were we trying to prove?’","lastModified":1432301240000,"standfirst":"They wound up audiences, were often too drunk to play and got banned from late-night TV.

What’s the latest?</strong><br>It’s not over until it’s over! Heathrow thinks it’s at Terminal 3, Virgin thinks it doesn’t exist, I want to believe Heathrow. Ten years ago, after a gig in London, three drunk teenage fans stole my ukulele from my dressing room, and I tweeted my despair. Three days later they showed up where I was staying, like frightened rabbits, holding my ukulele and apologising for having gotten drunk and stolen it. And I had such a wonderful time with them. I made them tea and sat them down and told them about my teenage shoplifting years, and it was a moment of true universal healing. And this is that ukulele, a $19 ukelele I’ve been touring with it for 10 years now, and it has seen some times.

Unfortunately, while the band had requested a size in feet, the model was made in metres, meaning they were dwarfed by stone slabs three times taller than expected. Which band was it?</p>\n <p>Spïnal Tap</p>\n <p>Black Sabbath</p>\n <p>Marillion</p>\n <p>Magnum</p>\n <p>3 Which headliner had their sets at Reading and Leeds in 2010 cut short when promoters pulled the plug?</p>\n <p>Arcade Fire</p>\n <p>Blink-182</p>\n <p>The Libertines</p>\n <p>Guns N’ Roses</p>\n <p>4 The festival – originally the National Jazz Festival – ran at several locations before settling in Reading in 1971. Which of the following racecourses has never hosted it?</p>\n <p>Windsor</p>\n <p>Epsom</p>\n <p>Plumpton</p>\n <p>Kempton Park</p>\n <p>5 Among the acts appearing at the 1972 festival were Genesis. But how much were they paid?</p>\n <p>£30</p>\n <p>£175</p>\n <p>£1,500</p>\n <p>£3,000</p>\n <p>6 What did Donita Sparks of L7 throw at disgruntled audience members in 1992?</p>\n <p>Her bottle of water</p>\n <p>Her guitar</p>\n <p>Her pet labradoodle, Patti</p>\n <p>Her tampon</p>\n <p>7 Kevin Rowland of Dexys Midnight Runners provoked the crowd into their traditional pastime of throwing bottles in 1999. What clothing was he wearing to so anger his audience?</p>\n <p>A T-shirt bearing the legend “Slough. Miles better than Reading.”</p>\n <p>A full-length coat made of wild mink fur</p>\n <p>A white dress, stockings and suspenders</p>\n <p>Nothing, apart from a leather codpiece with a flashing red light on its most protuberant point</p>\n <p>8 Which was the first hip-hop act to appear at Reading, in 1991?</p>\n <p>De La Soul</p>\n <p>Public Enemy</p>\n <p>NWA</p>\n <p>Third Bass</p>\n <p>9 Dave Grohl has played Reading and Leeds approximately 254 times.

Which of the following was he able to do?</p>\n <p>Add a white tiger to his private menagerie</p>\n <p>Install a two-thirds size replica of the Trevi fountain</p>\n <p>Fully restore the property’s 16th century watermill, and open it as an agricultural heritage museum</p>\n <p>Replace the urns at the cascade ponds</p> \n</figure>","linkText":"'All right Reading!' – test your knowledge of the

I know this because I’m puffing on one when he sways into his suite at the Savoy in central London, looking, I’m delighted to report, like a caricature of Keith Richards come to life. Smouldering Marlboro in one hand, glass in the other, shirt open, tight black jeans encasing legs so skinny you wonder how they support the rest of him, slight though the rest of him is. For all that people go on about the wrinkles on his face, Richards’ physique is a walking advert for the benefits of a diet he claims is largely composed of “meat and potatoes”, vodka and orange, and nicotine: “No, I don’t work out. No, no, no. I mean, I pick up those things” – he mimes lifting a dumbbell – “and go: ‘God, that’s too heavy.’ Then put them down.”</p><aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/17/keith-richards-crosseyed-heart-review\">Keith Richards: Crosseyed Heart review – everything a fan could hope for</a> </p> \n</aside>","linkText":"Keith Richards: ‘You don’t stop growing until they shovel the dirt in’","lastModified":1442530870000,"standfirst":"<p>At 71, the Rolling Stones legend is proud of his cartoon image as a rock outlaw.

One minute he’s talking about refusing to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/06/damon-albarn-roskilde-carried-off-stage-following-five-hour-set-africa-express\">leave the stage after a five-hour gig</a> with Africa Express (“Am I addicted to work?

It turns out he’s made a whole load of music, too","body":"<h2><strong>1 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwUXgzjd1x4\">Through the Wire</a></strong></h2> <p>Through the Wire, from West’s 2004 debut album The College Dropout, was arguably the most inspirational breakthrough hip-hop single since the Notorious BIG’s Juicy, released nine years earlier. It was inspired by a near-fatal car collision that required West to undergo reconstructive jaw surgery, which in turn meant he had to literally spit the verses through the wire. Although he had previously contributed guest vocals to Abstract Mindstate and Talib Kweli, Through the Wire was West’s first step on the journey from underground producer to megastar.<br /></p> <h2><strong>2<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYF7H_fpc-g\"> Jesus Walks</a></strong></h2> <p>West was never one to shy away from airing his beliefs, and the subject matter of his third single was incredibly contentious upon its 2004 release. In fact, it’s believed this song’s appearance on an early demo recording scared off some of the major labels who were interested in signing West. However, with the help of three music videos, a chorus hook delivered by the Addicts Rehabilitation Center Choir, not to mention a flawless, cadence-shifting lyrical flow, Jesus Walks has become perhaps the most evocative of any of West’s singles. And, despite alarming those major label executives, it became one of Kanye’s biggest hits.<br /></p> <h2><strong>3 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=455opdQ4so4\">Gold Digger</a></strong></h2> <p>West’s second album, 2005’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/aug/28/popandrock.shopping1\">Late Registration</a>, included West’s first US No 1 single as a lead artist, with Gold Digger eventually going quintuple platinum. He’d already appeared alongside Jamie Foxx on Twista’s US No 1 Slow Jamz. He teamed up with him again here, with Foxx reprising his performance in the film Ray to sing verses from Ray Charles’s I Got a Woman, with reworked lyrics to fit alongside West’s rap in this ingeniously executed track. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vwNcNOTVzY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6vwNcNOTVzY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do3iJ6DWvpQ\">4 Diamonds from Sierra Leone (Remix)</a></strong></h2> <p>Built around Shirley Bassey’s Bond theme Diamonds Are Forever, Diamonds from Sierra Leone seemed to encapsulate all the characteristics West had displayed on his rise: a buoyant flow, a provocative lyrical theme, and a judiciously deployed sample. However, the original recording was soon succeeded by an official remix. Not only did the lyrics of this version delve deeper into the trade in illegal African diamonds, it also featured a guest verse from long-term collaborator and label-mate Jay Z. <br /></p> <h2><strong>5 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZwMX6T5Jhk\">Love Lockdown</a></strong></h2> <p>West’s fourth album was released on 2008, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/21/kanye-west-808s-heartbreak\">808s &amp; Heartbreak</a> was a distinct change of pace from what had come before. It was preceded by the single Love Lockdown, which saw West taking inspiration from 80s synthpop, with its minimal production and heavy use of a Roland TR-808 drum machine. The single also featured a departure from the sleekly rapped vocal aesthetic of his earlier work, with his singing doing all of the talking, so to speak. His vocals appeared weak in contrast to his trademark raps, drenched in the Auto-Tuned effect he’d later become synonymous with. On paper, it sounds catastrophic, but the result was both fascinating and groundbreaking.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Kanye\">  <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:guardianmusic:playlist:7i5asq7DMXK5FUIWglwV6V\" width=\"460\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>6 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bm5iA4Zupek\">Runaway</a></strong></h2> <p>In the buildup to 2010’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/nov/19/kanye-west-review\">My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</a>, West found himself in a peculiar position. He’d become as famous for his statements and actions as for his music, making international headlines in 2009 when he stormed the stage during Taylor Swift’s acceptance speech for the best video award at the Grammys. He had split, publicly and acrimoniously, from his girlfriend Amber Rose in 2010, and he was still grieving for his mother, who had died in November 2007. He faced a choice: watch his public persona spiral into artistic insignificance, or he could strive to reaffirm himself and his career. Against all odds, the latter was achieved with My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, West’s most captivating album, which expressed a vulnerability rarely seen before. The single Runaway, accompanied by a Moonwalker-inspired promo film, is an epic tale of self-deprecation, love and loss, offering a toast to the “douchebags”, “assholes”, “scumbags” and “jerk-offs” (each used as terms to describe West following the Taylor Swift controversy). </p> <h2><strong>7 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG_dA32oH44\">Niggas in Paris</a></strong></h2> <p>Hip-hop and fashion have long gone hand in hand, but few artists have shared West’s passion for the catwalk world. He has released collections for Nike, APC and, most recently, <a href=\"http://www.adidas.com/us/kanye\">Adidas</a>, and he name-drops his favourite designers throughout his verse on this cut from his collaborative album with Jay Z, Watch the Throne. Niggas in Paris saw the two MCs delivering an unfathomable rap masterpiece. It also popularised the term “cray” (a truncation of “crazy”), for better or worse. We’ll let you decide.<br /></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG_dA32oH44\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gG_dA32oH44?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><strong>8 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOrLNHbEzMg\">Clique</a></strong></h2> <p>Another collaboration with Jay Z, also featuring Big Sean, Clique would’ve settled comfortably alongside the rest of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/aug/02/jay-z-kanye-west-watch-throne\">Watch the Throne</a>, released the previous year. Instead, Clique found itself on West’s label GOOD Music’s compilation album Cruel Summer. Built around an implacable, unrelenting beat from producer Hit-Boy, which takes in eastern melodic themes, Clique builds to West’s contribution after verses from Big Sean and Jay Z, and when West arrives he doesn’t disappoint. He’s been discussing the CIA and luxury cars with George Tenet, the agency’s former director. He’s so newsworthy, he needs a personal news crew, he’s the new Elvis, and most of all: “I been talking to God for so long/That if you look at my life I guess he’s talking back.”<br /></p> <h2><strong>9 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT3swdCJrrg\">New Slaves</a></strong></h2> <p>West’s God complex had reached new heights come 2013 with the release of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jun/17/kanye-west-yeezus-review\">Yeezus</a>. He discarded the luscious, soulful production of his previous LP release for a harsh soundscape of fierce electro and acid house influences, without tempering the arrogance across the 10 tracks, the most hard-hitting of which was New Slaves, on which he teamed up with Frank Ocean. New Slaves explored historic racism, segregation and classism through a brave, undiluted musical assault. It was another middle finger directed towards just about everybody and everything that had stood against West over the past 35 years.<br /></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SoKFycTmVU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-SoKFycTmVU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2><strong>10 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WibQR0tQ0P8\">Only One</a></strong></h2> <p>Reverting to the heavy Auto-Tuned vocal style, Only One – West’s collaboration with Paul McCartney – appeared as if from nowhere as a New Year’s Day gift to the internet. This was another stark departure from music that had come immediately before. Gone is the angry, confrontational figure of Yeezus, with this single – an ode to his daughter – displaying West’s sensitive side. Billboard noted that the Auto-Tune tended to be used when West was at his most lyrically naked, and this song saw him addressing the spirit of his late mother, before being guided back to reflecting on the family he has made for himself.</p>","linkText":"Kanye West: 10 of the best","lastModified":1427288580000,"standfirst":"<p>The past week may have left you with the impression that Kanye West is most famous for annoying rock fans.

What took them so long?","body":"<p>In August 2006, the Avalanches’ record label issued a press release trumpeting the imminent release of the Australian collective’s second album. The follow-up to Since I Left You had already started to take on a vaguely mythic status. It had, after all, been six years since their debut album had become a vast critical and commercial success. It spawned both a string of hit singles and a succession of reviews that boggled over the painstaking work and imagination that must have gone into making it: more than 3,500 samples meticulously stitched together into a seamless hour of music. The band’s driving force, Robbie Chater described it as “60s-influenced, inspired by Phil Spector and the Beach Boys, but using dance music techniques”. Its appeal wasn’t just the technical wizardry involved. The music on Since I Left You had a weird emotional pull to it – <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpqm-05R2Jk\" title=\"\">some of it was euphoric</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLrnkK2YEcE\" title=\"\">some of it was funny</a>, but a lot was suffused with an infectious wistful melancholy – that led people to start writing articles <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/aug/19/favourite-album-avalanches\" title=\"\">describing it as their all-time favourite album</a> or too good to follow up.</p><p>The album’s tone might have had something to do with the circumstances of Chater’s life in the run-up to its making. “I started having a problem with alcohol when I was about 14 or 15. It’s been a lifelong thing, way pre the band,” he says. “By the time I was 21, I’d been a heavy drinker for a long, long time and my body was in a really bad way. I had a severe withdrawal issue, and ended up in intensive care for a number of weeks. I nearly didn’t make it, basically. Since I Left You came maybe two years after that, when I was sober and just glad to be alive. That’s a lot of the feeling and the joyousness behind that album – me at 23, making music and just happy to be alive, you know?”</p>","linkText":"‘We lost our minds’ – how the Avalanches spent the last 16 years","lastModified":1468530028000,"standfirst":"Robbie Chater and Tony Di Blasi spent the best part of two decades making the follow up to their debut Since I Left You.

<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jan/15/michael-kiwanuka-folk-singer-interview\">Michael Kiwanuka</a>’s second album was released. Called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TYlcVNI2AM\">Black Man in a White World</a>, it opened like an old field recording of a work song, or as Kiwanuka himself put it, “slave music”: handclaps and a distorted a capella vocal eventually giving way to beautifully orchestrated, but agitated-sounding funk, backing vocals repeating the title over and over again, as if determinedly hammering a point home. It was a pretty strident comeback, but, in one sense, not entirely surprising. For reasons that scarcely need pointing out, 2016 has been a year in which black artists have felt impelled to make music dwelling on the subjects of race and identity, a state of affairs exacerbated in Kiwanuka’s case by his curious position within British pop. Born in Muswell Hill to Ugandan parents, he works in a black musical tradition – a brand of folk-influenced soul indebted to Bill Withers and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/oct/30/terry-callier\">Terry Callier</a> – but, as he recently pointed out: “there’s not that many black people at my gigs”.</p><figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TYlcVNI2AM\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-TYlcVNI2AM?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TYlcVNI2AM\">Watch Michael Kiwanuka’s Black Man in a White World</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure>","linkText":"Michael Kiwanuka: Love & Hate review – soul-searching with the tang of authenticity","lastModified":1468530012000,"standfirst":"<p>Kiwanuka has found a troubled, compelling voice with an emotional honesty and stately self-assurance that shows other post-Drake melancholics up as imitators</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4zp7d","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/series/alexis-petridis-album-of-the-week","url":"/music/series/alexis-petridis-album-of-the-week","tagType":"Series","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Alexis Petridis's album of the week","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/series/alexis-petridis-album-of-the-week","description":"The Guardian head rock and pop critic's lead review from each week's G2 Film & Music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/popandrock","url":"/music/popandrock","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/soul","url":"/music/soul","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Soul","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/soul","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/reviews","url":"/tone/reviews","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/albumreview","url":"/tone/albumreview","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Album reviews","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/albumreview","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","url":"/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","tagType":"Tracking","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"UK Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/alexispetridis","url":"/profile/alexispetridis","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Alexis Petridis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/alexispetridis","twitterHandle":"alexispetridis","bio":"<p>Alexis Petridis is the Guardian's head rock and pop critic and the music editor of GQ magazine.

I didn't plan to. My chums and I had gone to the Ealing Club to see Alexis Korner's band, we turned up, and we got this lot instead: the Rolling Stones. Babies. Not up to Korner's standard, we thought, rather snottily. We'd never heard of them. What a disappointment. Even if it was reduced from 2s 6d to 2s for the Stones. They didn't even look that thrilling; ordinary jackets and woollies, hair a moderate length, Mick Jagger had a fairly chubby face and his V-necked leather jerkin wasn't very hip. But we soon grew to love them. I still do, and now here we are, 51 years later, Mick is 70 this Friday and his band is still going.</p><p>Good. Why not? In those days, nobody sneered at elderly musicians. We, and the Stones, admired them tremendously. Muddy Waters, Big Bill Broonzy, Howling Wolf and Leadbelly were all our heroes, and all old men. Nobody thought they ought to bow out and shut up because they were over 60. More recently no one droned on about wrinkles or sneered at the Cuban Buena Vista Social Club because they were getting on a bit. Compay Segundo, the singer, was 89. Beat that voice if you can. Nor would we now tell Barenboim or Alfred Brendel to take a rest. These performers all prove what I always thought – that musicians improve with age. They have more experience and they've practiced for longer.</p>","linkText":"Mick Jagger: still dancing at 70 | Michele Hanson","lastModified":1374830669000,"standfirst":"The Rolling Stones singer is proof that musicians often improve with age – and this fellow 70-year-old hopes he keeps going","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/3hhqf","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/mick-jagger","url":"/music/mick-jagger","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Mick Jagger","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/mick-jagger","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"society/older-people","url":"/society/older-people","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webTitle":"Older people","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/older-people","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/therollingstones","url":"/music/therollingstones","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"The Rolling Stones","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/therollingstones","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/popandrock","url":"/music/popandrock","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/glastonbury-2013","url":"/music/glastonbury-2013","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Glastonbury 2013","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/glastonbury-2013","description":"For previous years content visit our <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/glastonbury\">Glastonbury festival page</a>","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/glastonbury","url":"/music/glastonbury","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Glastonbury festival","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/glastonbury","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"uk/uk","url":"/uk/uk","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webTitle":"UK news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/comment","url":"/tone/comment","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Comment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/comment","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/michelehanson","url":"/profile/michelehanson","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Michele Hanson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michelehanson","bio":"<p>Michele Hanson is an author and Guardian columnist.

It is simply not the sort of project the Spielbergs, Scorseses and Coppolas would interest themselves in. Which is a very good reason why people like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/24/alan-parker-bugsy-malone-bafta\">Alan Parker</a> should exist, even if his collaborators on this extraordinary film, Roger Waters of Pink Floyd and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/jul/08/design.art\">Gerald Scarfe</a>, the artist, found his conception of it different to their own. At least something exists on celluloid, and millions who bought the album will see it.</p><p>The tensions between Parker, Waters and Scarfe have been well advertised, mostly by Parker. But he obviously doesn’t think they have resulted in a botch-up, and nor do I. I found the album inflated, uneven but still quite something and that’s exactly what the film is. Except that, as a piece of pure cinematic technique, it is touched with an originality of expression and a thunderous conviction that lifts it a little beyond what is was as simply as aural tour de force. Perhaps tension is sometimes a good thing to have around.</p>","linkText":"Pink Floyd's The Wall film review – archive, 15 July 1982","lastModified":1468557171000,"standfirst":"<p><strong>15 July 1982:</strong> ‘I found the album inflated, uneven but still quite something and that’s exactly what the film is’<br></p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4pv2x","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/pinkfloyd","url":"/music/pinkfloyd","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pink Floyd","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/pinkfloyd","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/popandrock","url":"/music/popandrock","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"theguardian/series/from-the-archive","url":"/theguardian/series/from-the-archive","tagType":"Series","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webTitle":"From the Guardian archive","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/series/from-the-archive","description":"Historical articles from the Guardian archive, compiled by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianlibrary\">@guardianlibrary</a>.

is not, it must be said, a glut of albums born out of improvising from within a 2 million gallon underground water tank. At least not yet. Perhaps next year, once Cistern’s influence has taken hold, a penchant for subterranean orchestral work will be all the rage. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/dec/20/jherek-bischoff-composed-review\">Jherek Bischoff</a> certainly has a knack for helping his compositions to find a wider audience. Earlier this year, he found acclaim when, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/10/amanda-palmer-interview-you-got-me-singing\">Amanda Palmer</a>, he put out mini tribute album <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/strung-out-in-heaven-bowie/id1081654713\">Strung Out in Heaven</a>, a collection of Bowie songs reconfigured for string quartet. <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/cistern/id1111611693\">Cistern</a> is similarly string-drenched but often conveys a more foreboding atmosphere – one where the echo-laden drums of The Wolf threaten to pummel any briefly escaping melody. Elsewhere, Cistern can be more traditional sounding than its experimental beginnings suggest (perhaps it wasn’t possible to record in the tank) with tracks such as The Sea’s Son relying on simple motifs and grand cinematic sweeps.</p><figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_XgKw1Axrg\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7_XgKw1Axrg?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Watch video for Cistern with Scrape Quartet\n </figcaption> \n</figure>","linkText":"Jherek Bischoff: Cistern review – foreboding and string-drenched","lastModified":1468531883000,"standfirst":"<p>(Leaf)</p>","main":"","displayHint":"","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4zzcc","isLive":false,"tags":[{"properties":{"id":"music/experimental-music","url":"/music/experimental-music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Experimental music","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/experimental-music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/music","url":"/music/music","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Music","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/music","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"culture/culture","url":"/culture/culture","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/classicalmusicandopera","url":"/music/classicalmusicandopera","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Classical music","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/classicalmusicandopera","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"music/popandrock","url":"/music/popandrock","tagType":"Keyword","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webTitle":"Pop and rock","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/popandrock","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"type/article","url":"/type/article","tagType":"Type","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","url":"/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","tagType":"Tracking","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"UK Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/reviews","url":"/tone/reviews","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"tone/albumreview","url":"/tone/albumreview","tagType":"Tone","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Album reviews","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/albumreview","references":[]}},{"properties":{"id":"profile/timjonze","url":"/profile/timjonze","tagType":"Contributor","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"global","webTitle":"Tim Jonze","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/timjonze","twitterHandle":"timjonze","bio":"<p>Tim Jonze is the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music\">music editor</a> of guardian.co.uk.
