On Wednesday, the Vote to End Hunger coalition plan to deliver a petition to Lester Holt, NBC newscaster and host of the first presidential debate, urging him to push the presidential candidates to address what they will do to alleviate poverty and end hunger in the US and worldwide. Holt will be moderating the first presidential debate at Hofstra University on 26 September.</p> <p>More than 42 million Americans, including 13.1 million children, struggled with hunger in 2015, the coalition said.<strong> </strong></p> <p>The drop in poverty and increase in household income was due to the strengthening labor market and growth in wages, according to Sheldon Danziger, president of Russell Sage Foundation.</p> <p>“Poverty declined so much because employment increased steadily in 2015, with the annual unemployment rate at 5.3% compared to 6.2% in 2014. In addition, 21 states and the District of Columbia increased their minimum wage rates in 2015,” he said. </p> <p>In both 2014 and 2015, the number of full time workers went up – with an additional 1.2 million men and 1.6 million women finding full time work in 2014 and another 1.4 million men and one million women finding full time work in 2015. This past month, the US economy added 151,000 jobs. August was the 71st consecutive month of overall job creation – the longest streak on record. The US Federal Reserve has previously said that the labor market is nearing full employment.</p> <p>The data released on Tuesday also showed that gender wage gap still persists – with women earning about 80 cents for every dollar earned by men in 2015. The gender wage gap has only decreased by one cent since 2014. While this is the smallest pay gap on record, it is no reason for celebration. </p> <p>“Women of America, if you are looking for a raise, don’t get your hopes up: the wage gap closed by only a penny last year,” said Emily Martin, vice-president for workplace justice at the National Women’s Law Center. “While a small step forward is better than standing still, over a 40-year career women still stand to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars to the wage gap. And for many women of color, the cost of the lifetime wage gap will still exceed a million dollars. We can’t afford to close this gap one penny at a time.” </p> <p>Black women working full time earned 63 cents for every dollar earned by white men. Hispanic women earned only 54 cents for every dollar earned by white men.</p>","wordcount":"822","commentCloseDate":"2016-09-16T15:00:00Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-09-13T12:39:58Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-09-13T15:07:16Z","internalComposerCode":"57d7f39ee4b07ac3d446bc32","internalPageCode":"2714882","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-09-19T13:26:34Z","productionOffice":"US","publication":"theguardian.com","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/52p35","shouldHideAdverts":"false","showInRelatedContent":"true","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/005ceeb3c1c052283822f966da7e05b67b10213c/0_187_5616_3370/500.jpg","legallySensitive":"false","lang":"en","internalRevision":"660","internalShortId":"/p/52p35"},"apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2016/sep/13/household-income-increase-poverty-us-census-report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/13/household-income-increase-poverty-us-census-report","webTitle":"Household incomes rose in 2015 for first time in eight years, US Census says","webPublicationDate":"2016-09-13T15:07:16Z","sectionName":"US news","sectionId":"us-news","type":"article","id":"us-news/2016/sep/13/household-income-increase-poverty-us-census-report","rights":{"syndicatable":"true"},"section":{"id":"us-news","webTitle":"US news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news","editions":[{"id":"us-news","webTitle":"US news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news","code":"default"}]},"isHosted":false},"packages":[]}}
