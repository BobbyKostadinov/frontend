It must be hard being the least cool people on the planet.</strong> Don’t you believe it! That C of E gang, they’re cool all right. They’ve got a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLecK8GovYoaYzIgyOElKZg\">YouTube channel</a>.</p> <p><strong>How many subscribers?</strong> 1,348.</p> <p><strong>I see.</strong> And they’re into fashion!</p> <p><strong>No, don’t, please …</strong> Oh yes! To mark <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/london-fashion-week\">London Fashion Week,</a> the C of E has made a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9vE3mfVCrE\">film</a> about Christians and God in the fashion industry.</p> <p><strong>They don’t have to do this. </strong>It’s already done. They’ve interviewed a vicar and two people who work in fashion.</p> <p><strong>Any of them famous models or designers? </strong>Not exactly. <a href=\"http://www.britishfashioncouncil.co.uk/BFC-Contact-profile/Simon-Ward\">Simon Ward</a> used to work in Selfridges menswear department and has been a fashion industry administrator for the past 35 years.</p> <p><strong>Is he the enfant terrible of fashion industry administration?</strong> I don’t think so.</p> <p><strong>What does he say?</strong> “A lot of people would ask the question: ‘What does God make of this industry?’”</p> <p><strong>Is he sure? Maybe 1,348 people would. What’s Ward’s answer?</strong> “God is really interested.”</p> <p><strong>Is this a wind-up? </strong>Nope. “If we look at the beginning of the Bible, God created. He’s a god of creativity.”</p> <p><strong>Isn’t he the God of everything? And so also the God of un-creativity?</strong> Ah but: “What did He do first? He created the seasons. So I think the fact that fashion changes a lot reflects God’s heart.”</p> <p><strong>What? That’s not even true! He </strong><a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1\"><strong>started with “the heavens and the earth”</strong></a><strong>. Then it’s “light”. Then “day” and “night”…</strong> Stop quibbling. The other person interviewed is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9vE3mfVCrE\">Chrissie Abbott</a>.</p> <p><strong>And what does she do? </strong>Apart from organising a prayer group, that’s troublingly vague. “Working for international fashion/luxury brands, winning the loyalty of VIPs worldwide,” apparently. Anyway, she says: “Lots of people look at us and think: ‘How can God be in the fashion industry?’”</p> <p><strong>Again, I’m not sure that a lot of people either look at her or think that. </strong>But you can see what she’s driving at, right? Besides being cool, fashion is associated with sweatshops, anorexia, ego mania and conspicuous consumption. So maybe the industry does need better ethics.</p> <p><strong>Maybe. What does the video say God would think of the many gay people who work in fashion?</strong> Oh, um. It doesn’t say.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “We put the I CAN into Anglicanism!”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Church of England, don’t ever change.”</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"3","wordcount":"423","commentCloseDate":"2016-09-20T06:00:41Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-09-16T13:53:19Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-09-17T06:00:41Z","internalComposerCode":"57dbf94fe4b0c762d480d1b9","internalOctopusCode":"11908579","internalPageCode":"2723936","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-09-18T23:05:11Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-09-19T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The

Instead of singing it, though, you may wish to stream it, and get the man who made it out of a bit of a spot.</p> <p><strong>Oh dear. What has he done now? Is he – ha ha – in a bit of a “</strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WYHDfJDPDc\" title=\"\"><strong>Dilemma</strong></a><strong>”?</strong> You could say that. It’s been reported that Nelly hasn’t been paying his taxes, and not just in a “skimping on the odd bit and attempting to attribute it to spurious expenses” way.

You don’t just have that knocking about. Is he going to be able to pay it? </strong>Well, his <a href=\"http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/09/fans-rally-to-save-nelly-by-streaming-his-music.html?mid=twitter_nymag\" title=\"\">fans hope they will be able to help</a>, and have started the <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/hashtag/savenelly?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Ehashtag\" title=\"\">#savenelly</a> hashtag to ensure everybody knows of his unfortunate “having to pay back money he actually owes” plight. “I couldn’t save <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/12/harambe-the-meme-that-refused-to-die\" title=\"\">Harambe</a>,” says <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CocoCaliente_/status/775547494633644032\" title=\"\">one devotee</a>, “but goddammit I’m saving you.”</p> <p><strong>How are they going about it? Sponsored walks? Crowdfunding site?</strong> They’re going to save Nelly the way that surely every artist wants to be saved – via the gift of their music. It has been calculated that if you stream Nelly’s music enough times through Spotify, it will earn him enough money to pay back the taxes he owes.</p> <p><strong>And how many times is that?</strong> Somewhere between 280m and 403m.</p> <p><strong>That’s quite a lot of Nelly.</strong> Yes it is. Indeed, it was calculated that if one person were to pay off Nelly’s tax debt by themselves, simply by streaming <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeZZr_p6vB8\" title=\"\">Hot In Herre</a> over and over again and accumulating the microscopic royalty that goes with each stream, it would take 2,076 years to settle the debt.</p> <p><strong>Nelly probably doesn’t want to wait that long.</strong> One option, of course, is to follow the example of the not-very-notable funk band <a href=\"http://vulfpeck.com/\" title=\"\">Vulfpeck</a>.</p> <p><strong>I am not familiar with their music.</strong> You don’t have to be. They, though, had the idea that if they released 31-second snippets of silence, which effectively qualify as a “play” according to Spotify’s 30-second rule, they could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/mar/19/spotify-streaming-silence-vulpeck-make-money\" title=\"\">ask their fans to stream silence all night</a> and accumulate cash for

Pleasantries. According to Meyer, 41 seconds of each transaction in California is spent chatting with the server. That’s 41 seconds you have to add to every person in front of you in the baskets-only line. This adds up.</p> <p><strong>I think I’ve spotted the flaw in your argument.</strong> You have?</p> <p><strong>This is based on a study carried out in California, where it’s sunny and people generally like each other.</strong> So you’re saying that in the UK, where it’s rainy and miserable and everyone clomps about quietly hating everything they see, the results will be different.</p> <p><strong>Exactly. Again, this Meyer chap really needs to get to a Lidl.</strong> Wait, though, we can still adapt these findings to British supermarkets.</p> <p><strong>We can? </strong>Sure. Instead of looking at trolleys or the number of people in front of you, just keep an eye open for the chatty checkout assistants and avoid them at all costs.</p> <p><strong>I get it. </strong>Same goes for shoppers. If anyone in front of you looks lonely, then they’ll probably gab on, too.

Bring-backery.</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> From the old days, when things were bad and people were stupid.</p> <p><strong>Appearance: </strong>Awful.</p> <p><strong>I’ve heard a lot about this lately.</strong> Of course you have. It’s because of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/09/theresa-may-to-end-ban-on-new-grammar-schools\" title=\"\">Theresa’s May’s decision to end the grammar school ban</a>, even though it’s silly and wrong and nobody wants it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/09/theresa-may-to-end-ban-on-new-grammar-schools\">Theresa May to end ban on new grammar schools</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Who came up with the term? </strong>It’s thought <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidwilletts\" title=\"\">Lord Willetts</a>, the former universities minister who strongly opposes selective schooling, invented it in a 2005 speech about the dangers of mindless traditionalism. Back then, he compared it to “a man trying to repair a broken cobweb with his own hands”.</p> <p><strong>And grammar schools represent bring-backery? </strong>Absolutely. For all of May’s talk about social mobility, it’s a deliberately retrograde policy rooted in the mistaken belief that things were better in the past.</p> <p><strong>They were, though, weren’t they? We had Postman Pat back then, and </strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starburst_(confectionery)\" title=\"\"><strong>Opal Fruits</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Oh, do be quiet you moronic nostalgia-obsessed nimrod. Nothing was better in the past. It was different, that’s all. Things were bad then, and things are bad now. They’re just different types of bad, is all.</p> <p><strong>Who else has used the phrase?</strong> In 2007, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron\" title=\"\">David Cameron</a> referenced it during another row about grammar schools, saying: “In many ways, ‘bring back grammars’ is a meaningless slogan … It is a classic example of fighting a battle of the past rather than meeting the challenges of the future.”</p> <p><strong>Ah, Cameron. I miss him. </strong>No you don’t, you backwards-looking moron. He was terrible.</p> <p><strong>Is bring-backery exclusively about grammar schools, then?</strong> Nope. Look at that ridiculous campaign to <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1537388/its-time-to-bring-back-the-famous-dark-blue-uk-passport-as-a-symbol-of-our-independence-after-brexit/\" title=\"\">make British passports blue again</a>. That is out-and-out bring-backery.</p> <p><strong>Right, so it’s what you say when someone attempts to resurrect an idea that died for good reason long ago? </strong>That’s right.</p> <p><strong>So when people want to ban metric measurements? </strong>Bring-backery!</p> <p><strong>And when they gripe about political correctness? </strong>They’re basically saying: “Bring back me getting away with being rude to brown folk.”</p> <p><strong>Wait, isn’t “bring-backery” just a facile term designed to shut down arguments with people you disagree with, instead of solving them in open debate like adults? </strong>Shut up, you ridiculous bring-backer.</p> <p><strong>Do say: </strong>“Don’t solve today’s problems with yesterday’s failed solutions.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say: </strong>“Bring back bringing back bring-backery.”</p>","newspaperPageNumber":"3","wordcount":"386","commentCloseDate":"2016-09-14T16:00:04Z","commentable":"true","creationDate":"2016-09-09T11:17:34Z","firstPublicationDate":"2016-09-11T16:00:04Z","internalComposerCode":"57d29a4ee4b013613fffb952","internalOctopusCode":"11886997","internalPageCode":"2703759","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","isPremoderated":"false","lastModified":"2016-09-15T13:32:30Z","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-09-12T00:00:00Z","productionOffice":"UK","publication":"The

Potatoes are umami. </strong>No, you idiot. Potatoes aren’t umami. Potatoes are starchy. That’s a completely different taste profile entirely.</p> <p><strong>Oh God. </strong>No, really, it is.

So now Tim Farron is saying that he wants to cut the number of disposable cups we use, by introducing a 5p levy.</p> <p><strong>Like we did with plastic bags? </strong>Exactly. We’ve used 6bn fewer plastic bags since the charge came in last year, raising almost £30m for charity in the process. Farron claims that a 5p cup charge would similarly reduce the number of cups by 2bn.</p> <p><strong>What a good idea. </strong>It’s not perfect, obviously. Like the supermarkets before them, coffee shops would have to introduce some sort of “cup for life” scheme.</p> <p><strong>You mean a cup? </strong>Yes, like a cup.

Absolutely different. This is all Tim Farron’s idea and from now on we should all refer to the 5p cup charge as the “definitely Tim Farron’s 5p cup charge”.</p> <p><strong>Will Tim Farron get this through parliament by himself, then?</strong> Good point.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Regardless of whose idea this is, this should be implemented as soon as possible.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “I didn’t bring a cup.
