this doctor (and Ukip candidate) right that EU migrants will destroy the NHS?","webPublicationDate":"2016-02-09T11:40:40Z","fields":{"body":"<p><strong>Name:</strong> Angus Dalgleish.</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> 66.</p> <p><strong>Appearance: </strong>Concerned.</p> <p><strong>Who he?</strong> A medical professor. Principal of the Cancer Vaccine Institute. Specialist in cancer immunology and HIV/Aids research.</p> <p><strong>Good for him! Is he in the news with a treatment breakthrough? Is there something to uplift us all for once rather than send us yet further into the deepening slough of despond?</strong> Umm …</p> <p><strong>Go on. </strong>He says the NHS is on its knees and “could collapse completely” because of immigrants from the EU that we are legally obliged to treat.</p> <p><strong>Did he perhaps say this while drunk at a private dinner party? </strong>No, it’s part of a speech he will deliver at a conference entitled “The Good Life After Brexit”.</p> <p><strong>Oh. This depresses me. </strong>He is a member of Ukip.</p> <p><strong>This depresses me more. </strong>He stood as its general election candidate last year in Sutton and Cheam.</p> <p><strong>But I expect doctors to be liberal! By which I mean intelligent! By which I mean liberal! </strong>We expect much. And sometimes we are disappointed.</p> <p><strong>Is he right, though? When a cancer expert says things, I sort of think maybe they are right? </strong>They are often right if they are saying things about cancer. About the cost of immigrants to Britain’s health services, not so much.</p> <p><strong>How so? </strong>Well, there’s the 2013 research that showed traffic – and money – flows many ways.</p> <p><strong>For example? </strong>Eighteen British hospitals <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/oct/24/medical-tourism-generates-millions-nhs-health\" title=\"\">made £42m from people coming here for treatment on 2010</a>. Health tourists in total spent about £219m on shopping, eating, transport and accommodation while they were here.

Vardy, who was still playing non-league football when he was 25, is now <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/top-scorers\" title=\"\">top of the goalscoring table</a>, and has set a new Premier League record for scoring in successive games.</p> <p><strong>Amazing.

a-t-il?</strong> Oh, it goes back thousands of years, to ancient Greece.</p> <p><strong>Apparence:</strong> Like a lovely little sunhat. It’s a diacritic that sits on top of letters in many modern languages, although most famously in French.</p> <p><strong>Et les Français? Pourquoi do they it use?</strong> Oh, it’s just part of how they write some words, to denote a vanished letter, usually an “s”.</p> <p><strong>Pourquoi need-they un diacritique special pour telling tout le monde que il y a un “s” disparu?</strong> Well, occasionally it helps distinguish between different words, such as <em>cote</em> (meaning level) and <em>côte</em> (meaning coast), but most of the time it just hangs around on words such as <em>être</em>, looking cool, but not really doing much.</p> <p><strong>Un peu comme les Français eux-selves?</strong> You might say that about our dear neighbours and allies. I couldn’t possibly comment. Although, as it happens, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/05/not-the-oignon-fury-france-changes-2000-spellings-ditches-circumflex\" title=\"\">Académie Française agrees with you, at least about the circumflex</a>.</p> <p><strong>L’académie Française! Les world-famous ultra-fogeys qui détestent le franglais?</strong> I’m not sure they would agree with the description, but, yes, them. They have issued a list of approved alternatives to some written French words, which have removed a lot of hyphens and the circumflex on such words as <em>coût</em> and <em>paraître</em>.</p> <p><strong>Mon dieu!</strong> Yes, that’s how France has reacted.</p> <p><strong>When ont-ils issued ces alternatives?</strong> Well, that’s the thing. In 1990.</p> <p><strong>Vingt-six years ago?</strong> Yes.</p> <p><strong>So pourquoi le brouhaha now? </strong>It seems that French publishers are as speedy as French bureaucrats, because <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/french-grammar-uproar-over-decision-to-implement-26-year-old-reform-of-spelling-rules-a6854441.html\" title=\"\">they only updated the school textbooks this year</a>. That was duly noticed by the TV station TF1, then social media got involved ... then student groups and politicians ...</p> <p><strong>Mais, changing la langue française! C’est un big deal, n’est-ce pas?</strong> Not very big in this case. Remember, these are only approved alternatives. Where the circumflex on an “i” or “u” has no effect on meaning, it is no longer obligatory, but no one will be marked wrong for continuing to use it.</p> <p><strong>So les Français ont overreacté to un very petit adjustment à leur way of life?</strong> That’s right.</p> <p><strong>Typique!</strong> Yes. No one ever overreacts to things over here.</p> <p><strong>Dire:</strong> “How could they ban a harmless little hat?”</p> <p><strong>Ne pas dire:</strong> “Well, they banned the

shock of red hair?</strong> Yep.</p> <p><strong>And that Phil Collins is a bald bloke from Chiswick? </strong>Oh fine, then. It’s not an exact resemblance. But still, that’s what he looks like spiritually. Phil Collins is the reincarnation of John W Smith. <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1333165/How-psychic-cook-called-Carolyn-convinced-Phil-Collins-hes-reincarnated-American-hero.html\">A psychic told him</a>.

Isn’t Phil Collins only newsworthy because he’s back with his ex-wife? </strong>Right, OK, yes. It has been reported that Phil Collins and Orianne Cevey have got back together, even though he is said to have paid her £25m in a divorce settlement nine years ago, and she got married to someone else and had a baby in the interim. </p> <p><strong>So what does that have to do with all this stuff about reincarnation? </strong>It’s linked, I promise. <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3429274/How-Phil-Collins-won-ex-wife-never-stopped-loving-d-married-man-d-paid-25m-divorce-money.html\">Reports</a> about the reunion suggest that – among other things – Phil’s obsession with the Alamo is what helped to drive Cevey away in the first place.</p> <p><strong>OK.</strong> And that in 2014, just as relations between the pair were starting to thaw, <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/100-million-phil-collins-alamo-collection-in-the-works-20141029\">he gave away most of his $100m Alamo collection to a museum in San Antonio, Texas</a>.</p> <p><strong>So Phil Collins has shed himself of Alamo paraphernalia in order to have a happy life with the woman he loves? </strong>I think that’s where we’ve gone with this.</p> <p><strong>And why are you bringing it back up? Because you want to remind him of an old obsession that may have helped to ruin his marriage? </strong>I never said that.</p> <p><strong>It is, though, isn’t it? You hate the idea of Phil Collins being happy. </strong>No, that’s not it! Just, you know, reincarnation is weird and it’s in the public interest to know if any pop stars have ever believed in anything that is slightly non-traditional, even if it’s completely benign.</p> <p><strong>No, it isn’t.</strong> No, you’re right, it isn’t.

So what is a “gossip bomb”?</strong> Hard to say exactly. The Holy Father was explaining how Jesus wants priests to do what the church authorities tell them, without being all awkward and questiony. As their numbers fall dramatically, they must also stick together, he said, and not divide communities by spreading gossip.</p> <p><strong>Yeah, because if the Catholic church has learned anything in the past few years, it is that priests must keep quiet when they hear about anything dodgy.</strong> Quite. Anyway, the pope then illustrated his point by saying that <a href=\"http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/pope-francis-encourages-religious-men-and-women-to-live-well-the-pillars-of?\">gossips are like terrorists setting off bombs in their communities</a>. “If you get an urge to say something against a brother or a sister, to drop a gossip bomb, bite your tongue,” he said. “Hard!”</p> <p><strong>Ow!</strong> Not you. You’re not a consecrated priest or nun in the Catholic church. You can gossip about whoever you like, as long as we can get it past the lawyers.</p> <p><strong>Thanks. Do you think maybe the pope was thinking of photobombs, the F-bomb and suchlike? </strong>It’s possible. These are just the kind of 21st-century phrases you would expect from a groovy, modern, 79-year-old celibate religious conservative. After all, he has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/nov/27/pope-francis-new-album-wake-up-rock\">released a rock album</a>, <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/film/news/pope-francis-movie-beyond-the-sun-1201693656/\">he is going to be in a film</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Pontifex?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">he gets tons of retweets</a> …</p> <p><strong>Sorry, did you say the pope is going to be in a film?</strong> That’s right.</p> <p><strong>What kind of film?</strong> It’s called Beyond the Sun, and it is “a family adventure based on the Gospels”.</p> <p><strong>Taking an ambivalent, critically engaged look at the Gospels?</strong> Probably more of a completely-believing-them one. It is being co-financed by the rum heiress <a href=\"http://www.ladymonikabacardi.com/en/monika-bacardi-cinema-activities.cfm\">Monika Bacardi</a>.

</strong>Yes, although in this case, I’ve made clever use of ambiguity, because “selfie teeth” are often a figment of your imagination.</p> <p><strong>I see. So you are giving me a brief, lighthearted guide to something that doesn’t exist? </strong>I am. Look, people have recently started taking a lot more close-up photographs of their own faces, or using their phones as mirrors. Agreed?</p> <p><strong>With a slow, lugubrious sigh, yes. </strong>And some phone cameras are fitted with slightly weird lenses that make things close to them look inflated at the centre of the screen.</p> <p><strong>If you say so.</strong> And as a result, a lot of people think they have huge, horse-like teeth. “Teeth often look more protruding than they are in real life, which can also be emphasised by the light of the flash,” Dr Tim Bradstock-Smith <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/health/news/article4679037.ece\" title=\"\">told the Times</a>.</p> <p><strong>Who’s he?</strong> Clinical director of something called the London Smile Clinic. “As teeth are at the centre of the image, people are understandably driven to make them look nicer,” he added.</p> <p><strong>“Understandably” is often just a nice way of saying “stupidly”, isn’t it? </strong>It is indeed. Anyway, Bradstock-Smith says that over the last five years he’s seen a 30% rise in people “sending in selfies with concerns about their front teeth”.</p> <p><strong>Interesting. Has he published his data? I mean that could just be four emails instead of three.</strong> No. Still, “when they come in, often the teeth don’t look too bad.” he says. “We dissuade two to three patients each week from treatment, and for many others, will recommend simple alignment of front teeth instead of major intervention.”</p> <p><strong>Wait a minute … so “many” of these people do actually end up paying to get their teeth fixed?</strong> Yup. “The two front teeth look good being a little more dominant, with a step in length between these and the next two,” Bradstock-Smith explains. “It creates a ‘smile curve’ and it’s a natural, feminine appearance.”</p> <p><strong>I’m confused. Are selfies making people needlessly anxious about their appearance, or helping them to spot defects they’d never seen before?</strong> Who says it can’t be both?</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “I promise that your teeth do not make you look ugly.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say: </strong>“It’s more of a whole-face issue.”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"11216670","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-02-02T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2448691","internalRevision":"50","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"A combination of extreme close-ups and smartphone lenses is making people think their teeth are too big.

<p><strong>Age:</strong> Perpetually about 19.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Silent and weird-looking.</p> <p><strong>How can you say that?</strong> <strong>Every little girl wants to be a Disney princess.</strong> Do they? Do they really want to grow up as a pretty afterthought on the sideline to everyone else’s story?</p> <p><strong>Oh, come on. What is Snow White if not the story of Snow White herself?</strong> The story of loads of men tasked with fixing an unconscious woman’s problem, that’s what. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/01/25/researchers-have-discovered-a-major-problem-with-the-little-mermaid-and-other-disney-movies/\" title=\"\">according to research published by linguists Carmen Fought and Karen Eisenhauer</a>, female characters only had 50% of that film’s dialogue.</p> <p><strong>Fine, bad example. What about Beauty and the Beast?</strong> Women only spoke 29% of the lines in that, and that’s even if we take the unusual step of assigning a gender to that creepy singing teapot.</p> <p><strong>Little Mermaid? </strong>You mean the one where the ostensible protagonist is literally banned from talking for the majority of the film?</p> <p><strong>Good point.</strong> And don’t suggest Frozen next, either. Even though you cannot remember a single male character from that film, they still outnumbered female characters two to one.</p> <p><strong>This is awful. Can something be done? </strong>Maybe. Production of the Disney Princess toy range <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-disney-princess-hasbro/\" title=\"\">has just shifted from Mattel to Hasbro</a>, which wants to introduce a new realism in order to change how we think about princesses.</p> <p><strong>Really? </strong>Sort of. Mattel’s Disney princesses were notoriously Barbie-like; all elegant and gossamer, held in passive poses with their tiny heads resting on top of ridiculous necks.</p> <p><strong>And now? </strong>They come in different heights and body types, and they’re more distinct. The emphasis is apparently now on what the princesses can do, rather than how they look.</p> <p><strong>And what can they do?</strong> Hasbro seems especially keen on Tiana from The Princess and the Frog, mainly because she’s apparently “a great cook”. Women like to cook, right?</p> <p><strong>It’s a step forward, I guess. What do these new Hasbro dolls sound like?</strong> Oh, they still don’t talk. This is Disney, remember, not the National Young Feminist Leadership Conference.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Finally, my daughter can now better identify with these magical figures of entrenched privilege.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Mummy, look, Mulan’s thighs scrape together when she walks! Just like yours!”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"11208658","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-02-01T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2447373","internalRevision":"63","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"Female Disney characters routinely have fewer lines than males even in films in which they’re the lead.

That’s him.</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> 45.</p> <p><strong>Pity.</strong> I know. You may have noticed that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/may/04/aled-jones-lorraine-kelly-daybreak\">he’s a TV and radio presenter these days</a>. But don’t despair! He’s about to release a brand new album sung in the same treble that stole everybody’s heart.</p> <p><strong>What, a middle-aged man doing a whole album in pretend-child falsetto? Isn’t that a bit creepy and weird?</strong> It would be, but no. This is a real boy soprano.</p> <p><strong>Dear God! You mean he’s castrated himself?</strong> Castration prevents the voice box and vocal cords from growing during puberty. I don’t think they will come back afterwards. And anyway, no, I’m pretty sure he hasn’t done that. This is just a secret album recorded a long time ago but never heard in public.</p> <p><strong>A bit like </strong><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/wu-tang/\"><strong>that one the Wu-Tang Clan did</strong></a><strong>?</strong> Um, kind of. Except this is a collection of folk songs that Jones sang as a child. His record company decided not to release it when his voice broke soon afterwards.</p> <p><strong>That’s a bit mean.</strong> That’s showbiz. Jones had forgotten all about it <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/12122640/Aled-Jones-to-duet-with-teenage-self-after-finding-lost-album-in-airing-cupboard.html\">until his mum reminded him</a>. “When she asked my dad where it was, he said that the tape of recordings was in the airing cupboard, to keep it dry, sandwiched in between my old pants and socks,” he says.</p> <p><strong>Were these special pants and socks? Why were his parents keeping them?</strong> He doesn’t say. Anyway, Jones listened to the music and liked it, which gave him the idea of releasing it now – but with an innovative new twist.</p> <p><strong>Oh no. What is it? </strong><a href=\"http://www.classicfm.com/artists/aled-jones/news/one-voice/#ffjO0ooOP2ABqjKS.97\">He’s duetting with himself</a>.</p> <p><strong>Eh?</strong> The present-day, baritone Jones will accompany his former, treble, self.</p> <p><strong>The Highs and Lows of Aled Jones!</strong> Very good, but no. It’s actually called One Voice, and it includes famous tunes such as All Through the Night and Danny Boy.</p> <p><strong>You just can’t hear Danny Boy too often, can you?</strong> That’s one opinion.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “How about a duet between the child Aled Jones and the child <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/charlotte-church\">Charlotte Church</a>?”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “How about him and Method Man?”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"11202035","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-01-28T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2446120","internalRevision":"70","publication":"The Guardian","trailText":"The Welsh presenter will duet with his younger self on a lost album of folk songs found in his mum’s airing cupboard","allowUgc":"false","headline":"Aled Jones sings soprano again – but it’s not as drastic as that sounds","isInappropriateForSponsorship":"false","commentable":"true","firstPublicationDate":"2016-01-27T17:46:05.732Z","secureThumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2e14a17847fc9527be62d852f7b39553c8b86ab/0_160_3600_2160/140.jpg","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4g7cx","wordcount":"366","shouldHideAdverts":"false","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/f2e14a17847fc9527be62d852f7b39553c8b86ab/0_160_3600_2160/140.jpg","isPremoderated":"false","internalComposerCode":"56a8eb04e4b0117874a29359","newspaperPageNumber":"3","commentCloseDate":"2016-01-30T17:45:00+00:00","standfirst":"<p>The Welsh presenter will duet with his younger self on a lost album of folk songs found in his mum’s airing cupboard</p>","linkText":"Aled Jones sings soprano again – but it’s not as drastic as that sounds","showInRelatedContent":"true","lastModified":"2016-01-28T14:36:41.000Z","legallySensitive":"false","internalContentCode":"502446120"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2016/jan/27/aled-jones-sings-soprano-again-but-its-not-as-drastic-as-that-sounds","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/music/shortcuts/2016/jan/27/aled-jones-sings-soprano-again-but-its-not-as-drastic-as-that-sounds","sectionName":"Music","elements":[{"id":"f2e14a17847fc9527be62d852f7b39553c8b86ab","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/f2e14a17847fc9527be62d852f7b39553c8b86ab/0_160_3600_2160/2000.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Copyright (c) 1986 Rex Features.

</strong>52.</p> <p><strong>Appearance: </strong>Neat, tidy, repetitive.</p> <p><strong>Who is she?</strong> She is an Irish designer, famous for simplified flower patterns that are now a middle-class cliche.</p> <p><strong>Is she that woman who thinks it’s the 1960s?</strong> I don’t know whether she thinks that in her personal life. Actually, I’m fairly sure she doesn’t. But yes, there is a soupcon of the midcentury about <a href=\"http://www.johnlewis.com/search?No=0&amp;Nrpp=90&amp;Ntt=orla+kiely\">her homewares</a>.</p> <p><strong>A soupcon?</strong> All right, a vat. Anyway, she is very, very successful. Her Stem design is the new Burberry or something.</p> <p><strong>Great. Although didn’t you tell me last week that we had reached “peak curtains”?</strong> That’s right. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2016/jan/18/peak-curtains-ikea-sustainability-home-furnishings-repair-recycle\">Steve Howard from Ikea said so</a>, and Kiely agrees with him. “I don’t like our throwaway culture,” she told the Radio Times. “The world is full of stuff and it is too much.”</p> <p><strong>So another stuff manufacturer says we’re manufacturing too much stuff? </strong>That’s right.</p> <p><strong>Hypocrisy, maybe? </strong>They did put that to Kiely, and to be fair to her, she agrees. “I am adding to it,” she said, “but I am hoping that people who buy my stuff will keep it for ever. But you are right. At the end it is still cluttering.”</p> <p><strong>Well, as long as she is hoping her customers act responsibly. What more could anyone do? </strong>She also provides a repair service for Orla Kiely products, paid for, once they are out of warranty.</p> <p><strong>Are they made only out of sustainable or recycled materials? </strong>Her website doesn’t say. Which suggests probably not.</p> <p><strong>So should I despise her for peddling stuff or admire her for admitting it?</strong> Just accept that customers and suppliers are part of a complex web of behaviour, in which we are all responsible for trying to do our best.</p> <p><strong>Maybe I’ll just blame you. </strong>Whatever works.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Ooh, that’s a nice towel! It will match our duvet, pillowcases, cushion, mug, storage jar, phone case, utensils pot, bread bin, coasters, tealight lantern, tea towel, plant pot, place mats, salad bowl, bath set, watch, pen, butter dish, sugar bowl, scented candle gift set, address book, sling bag, washbag, umbrella, notebook, throw, diffuser set, secateurs, hand cream, gardening fork, gardening journal, tool box, shower gel, string in a tin, flask, hand wash, saucepan, cake dome, casserole dish, trowel, oven gloves, holdall, tableware, bin, magazine rack and wallpaper.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Yes, but where will <em>we</em> go?”</p>","internalOctopusCode":"11197939","productionOffice":"UK","newspaperEditionDate":"2016-01-27T00:00:00Z","hasStoryPackage":"false","internalPageCode":"2445208","internalRevision":"91","publication":"The
