Robert Lowell and Paul Muldoon are among the tutelary presences: hints of <a href=\"https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/text/brief-guide-new-york-school\">the New York School</a> are mixed with the thrum of popular song, country and the Beatles included. The Learn’d Astronomer, like other Robbins poems, makes the present participate in a “learn’d” but direct conversation across cultures and periods through humour, intellectual range and the compression of its form.<br /></p> <p> The poem’s opening rhetorical question may implicate everyone, not only poets, in the romantic fallacy (“How long must we hymn the twinkling stars”). In a comic-relativist proposition that the stars “are no more distant/than the glow-in-the-dark stickers adorning/the ceiling of my first girlfriend’s boudoir”, the vagueness is a studied impudence against both the measurer of distance and the meditator on vastness. Distance, after all, can refer to time as well as space. Try turning the idea the other way round: imagine Robbins’s speaker had said that the glowing stickers of a girlfriend’s “boudoir” were no more distant than the stars. It would become a conventional, if hopefully understated, romantic plaint about lost love or youth. </p> <p> Robbins is positioning “the twinkling stars” of the popular poetic imagination as no more than verbal cliche – but the original “<a href=\"https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/when-i-heard-learned-astronomer\">learn’d astronomer</a>” who, with his charts and maths, drove Walt Whitman out of the lecture room to commune directly with the starry, starry night, is clearly not this poem’s hero, either. The sceptical intelligence seems to see science as a contributor to the transcendental fallacy.</p> <p> From the irony of “boudoir”, the poem skips over the stanza break to give us what might seem more heartfelt, the sighting of the “teenage planet”. This is the cue for the second subject of the sonata-like structure. Engagingly, Robbins complicates the critique by presenting his speaker as a crazily precocious teenager. The anaphora is insistent across the stanza break: </p> <p> Even then, I was so skillful a lover<br />that when I said ‘Life is wasted on the living,’<br />the rivers ran for days with suicides.<br /></p> <p>Even then, I knew the stars to be empty cans.<br /></p> <p>An extended non-sequitur, apparently connecting an outbreak of mass suicide to the teenager’s brilliance as a lover and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Restaurant_at_the_End_of_the_Universe\">his quotation from Douglas Adams</a>, may give the game away. The speaker is quarrelling with an earlier self.</p> <p> Teenage self-aggrandisement is seen off in the third stanza: there’s no appetite for a reincarnation of the 16-year-old Red Bull-addicted gamer: “I’d loose adders on the man who claimed such power.” (Adders are snakes, of course, but perhaps the word alludes here to the arithmetical addition mentioned by Whitman.) A nihilist who exaggerates his nihilism risks losing credibility, risks the nihilism itself. But the poem pushes on with the project: after the demolition of the constellations there’s another cosmic shock in store for us regarding “the art of love”. Robbins is a precise writer: he means “plastic” in its several adjectival meanings in “plastic toy” (not only “made of plastic”, but malleable, and fake) and, in “caramel corn”, combines two meanings of “corn”. But note the oddity: it’s not love that’s buried in the sticky conglomeration, but “the art of love”. We might need to think about Ovid (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ch2qVvZ1Ug\">and/or Neil Diamond?</a>) as well as bad, fumbling sex before we move on. Rhyme, a subtle, flickering presence in parts of the poem, indicts intellectual clumsiness here in the judicious pairing of “ignorance” and “romance”.</p> <p> The address to “you virgins” echoes the old <em>carpe diem</em> motif but strongly implies that there is no day worth plucking. The last stanza is played at first for comedy: it’s great fun to imagine love poets who “couldn’t write their way out of a bag of kitty litter” (an image that might relate distantly to that of the plastic toy in the tub of popcorn). The verse grows unruly and acquires an extra line, as if to accommodate all the “junk”. That bodies and stars are one substance provides the reverse of consolation. The final lines perhaps equate the Safeway trolley with the poem, and the creation of the poem with acts of wheeling and recycling. In this case, “I’m pushing” becomes a performative statement. It reminds us that we humans manipulate our material, whether it’s poems and stars. They can, at least temporarily, become what the writer wants them to be, his comfort, his joke, his terror.</p> <ul> <li>Michael Robbins is the author of two collections, Alien vs Predator and The Second Sex.

than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/28/ed-balls-labour-minister-memoir\">Ed Balls</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/05/alan-johnson-lay-off-last-labour-government-if-you-want-to-get-elected\">Alan Johnson</a>. Balls, a middle-class product of Oxford and Harvard, was a bright, driven, occasionally intimidating presence throughout 13 years of Labour government. For much of that time he was a backroom boy at the frenetic court of chancellor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/10/inspiring-view-britishness-defeat-brexit-isolationists\">Gordon Brown</a>, ending up as education secretary in Brown’s cabinet.</p> <p>Johnson, by contrast, was the orphaned child of an impoverished single mother, who started his working life as a warehouse assistant in the Hammersmith branch of Tesco, rising by some almost miraculous process, via the postal sorting office at Slough, to hold five cabinet posts.</p> <p>For all that Balls had a reputation as a political bruiser, <strong>Speaking Out</strong> is a thoughtful memoir, sometimes self-deprecating, occasionally boastful, but always rational and balanced. There are hints at the difficulty of working for so volatile and demanding a political master as Gordon Brown, but no great revelations. Of the low-intensity warfare between Downing Street and the Treasury that dogged Tony Blair’s premiership, in which Balls undoubtedly played a part, he says little except that there was fault on both sides.</p> <p>Clearly there was no love lost between Balls and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/aug/09/ed-miliband-endorses-owen-smith-for-labour-leader\">Ed Miliband</a>, whom he worked alongside both in the Treasury and later as shadow chancellor under Miliband’s leadership. For much of the time they were barely communicating. “We would go for days, sometimes weeks, without a conversation.” At times, history seemed to be repeating itself. “When members of [Ed Miliband’s] inner circle would brief against me from time to time, he clearly found it painful and offensive, and would apologise in a very heartfelt way. But as with Tony and Gordon, years before, his apparent dismay didn’t stop it happening.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/audio/2016/sep/07/ed-balls-strictly-versus-politics-true-meaning-of-brexit-politics-weekly-podcast\">Ed Balls on Strictly versus politics, plus the true meaning of Brexit – Politics Weekly podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The one thing not explained in any detail is New Labour’s love affair with the bankers and enthusiasm for so-called “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/dec/12/labour-regulations-city-rbs-collapse\">light-touch regulation</a>”. As a casual reading of Brown’s annual Mansion House speeches demonstrates, he became more and more sycophantic with each year that passed. Towards the end of his term, the chancellor was positively euphoric, singing the praises of the City for inventing “the most modern instruments of finance” and going so far as to assert that, thanks to the genius of the City, we were living in “a new golden age”. All this addressed to some of the very people who helped bring the global financial system to the edge of ruin. Presumably Balls had something to do with it. Indeed, he gave one or two similar speeches of his own. It would be of interest to know how such intelligent people as Balls and Brown could possibly have bought into such nonsense, and yet the author offers little by way of explanation.</p> <p>Balls is at his best when he is in a reflective mood. There are chapters entitled Ambition, Image, Risks, Spin, Emotion, Mistakes, Hinterland. In a chapter headed Assumptions, he points out that just about all the assumptions he shared with the other bright young things in his class at Harvard 25 years ago turned out to be wide of the mark or just plain wrong. No one foresaw the rise of China or that the impact of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/globalisation\">globalisation</a> would become about the movement of people – rich and poor – with the potential to destabilise existing economic systems.</p> <p>Come the general election in May 2015, Balls’s world fell apart. Had Labour won, he would have become chancellor. In the event, not only did the chancellorship elude him, but he lost his seat in parliament. Suddenly, after 20 years at the centre of events, he found himself out of work, aged only 48. Even so, he is not short of things to do, lecturing at Harvard, chairing the board of his beloved Norwich City, competing in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/04/strictly-come-dancing-launch-show-draws-more-than-10m-viewers\"><em>Strictly Come Dancing</em></a>. Plus, of course, he has more time to devote to his family. This book is part memoir, part therapy. In the long run, I suspect that out of politics he will be a happier man.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a6c0ea855fab9d1944ebd161b58dae19a4d3070\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a6c0ea855fab9d1944ebd161b58dae19a4d3070/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alan Johnson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alan Johnson: ‘I had no wide network of contacts and I’d never been to a dinner party in my life.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/long-and-winding-road.html\"><strong>The Long and Winding Road</strong></a><strong> </strong>is the third and final volume of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/aug/13/politics.economicpolicy\">Alan Johnson</a>’s remarkable memoir. It opens in the early 1990s as our hero is about to become general secretary of the Union of Communications Workers. In this role his principal (and not inconsiderable) achievement was to see off attempts by the then Tory government to privatise the Post Office.</p> <p>Then, as the 1997 election approached, he receives a call from Tony Blair asking if he fancies becoming a Labour MP, a thought that had never previously occurred to him. With just two weeks to go he is shoehorned into a safe Labour seat in Hull and, with another wave of Blair’s magic wand, is soon wafted into government. Over the next decade he holds no fewer than seven ministerial jobs, eventually ending up as home secretary under Gordon Brown.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/05/alan-johnson-lay-off-last-labour-government-if-you-want-to-get-elected\">Alan Johnson: 'Lay off last Labour government if you want to get elected'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The way he tells it, and there is no reason to doubt his version, it all seems so effortless. At no stage does he ever seem to have lobbied anyone in the hope of preferment. Nor was he ever part of any particular faction. Unlike some, he was not consumed by politics.</p> <p>“I was reasonably well informed,” he writes, “but I didn’t scour the print media every day or devour political biographies, or watch the Sunday morning political programmes on TV. I certainly hadn’t formed an ‘opinion’ on every issue as proper politicians are meant to do. I had no wide network of contacts and I’d never been to a dinner party in my life.”</p> <p>The tale ends with Johnson becoming <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/nov/02/alan-johnson-immigration\">home secretary</a>. He does not address the possibility that had he not been so laid-back he might easily have become leader and perhaps prime minister. Fittingly, he ends with a tribute to his mother, Lily, who after a miserably short life died, tragically, at 42, never knowing how life would turn out for young Alan and his redoubtable sister, Linda. If only she could have known, she would have been so proud.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/chris-mullin\"><em>Chris Mullin</em></a><em> is a former Labour minister.

sweeping history of violence puts our fears about crime into perspective","byline":"Joe Moshenska","body":"<p>No recent moment has better captured the warped place of violence in modern political discussion than an exchange between <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnhJWusyj4I\" title=\"\">Newt Gingrich and a CNN journalist</a> during the Republican national convention. Donald Trump had referred to “poverty and violence at home”, but the journalist pointed out that violent crime across the US has, in fact, progressively declined. “The average American does not think crime is down,” said Gingrich.</p> <p>“People feel more threatened,” the journalist insisted, “but the facts don’t support it.”</p> <p>“As a political candidate, I’ll go with what people feel,” retorted Gingrich, “and you go with the theoreticians.”</p> <p>As James Sharpe observes in the conclusion to his sweeping and ambitious history of violence in England, a similar disconnect obtains in this country: “All the statistics show that we are highly unlikely to fall prey to the murderous stranger,” he writes, “but clearly that’s not what many of us believe.” Sharpe, a social historian of English crime and witchcraft, moves nimbly between the presentation and analysis of statistics and vivid vignettes of particular crimes. He is also alert to the inescapable gaps in the historical record, and the persistent tendency to overstate the significance of lurid and eye-catching instances of violence. (I was reminded, during one of his asides on the likelihood of unreported transgressions, of Chris Morris’s satirical deadpan in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPrCsfd1E64\" title=\"\"><em>Brass Eye</em></a>: “So much for recorded crimes. But crimes we know nothing about are going up as well.”) Sharpe illuminates the point that Gingrich seeks to exploit: the history of English violence is inextricably the history of how such violence has been construed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sharpe's calm and judicious presentation is the perfect antidote to the scaremongering of Newt Gingrich and his ilk</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Somewhat surprisingly, for a book whose pages bristle with head-bashings, stabbings, hangings and myriad forms of inflicted misery, the overall story that Sharpe seeks to tell is an optimistic one. Like Steven Pinker’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/07/better-angels-steven-pinker-review\" title=\"\"><em>The Better Angels of Our Nature</em></a> – which argued that the entirety of human history has involved a slow drift away from violence – Sharpe argues for a reduction of violence as a basic fact of everyday life across the centuries in England.</p> <p>Much of the book is based around specific spheres in which violent behaviour once occurred, but in which brutality has become ever less widely accepted. Duelling, initially seen as “more civilised than random violence”, had come by the Victorian age to seem “bloodthirsty and antiquated”. Sports that had openly incorporated forms of deliberate harm – such as the “hackers” in rugby whose explicit role was kicking and tripping opposing players – gradually ruled against such nastiness: one commentator complained that this would “do away with all the courage and pluck of the game”. The routine beating of wives, children and servants all came to be socially stigmatised if not outlawed.</p> <p>Sharpe is too careful a historian to be unaware of both the advantages and the risks of such a narrative. His calm and judicious presentation is the perfect antidote to the scaremongering of Gingrich and his ilk, and to the fears, stoked by the tabloids, that the lurking malevolence of particular groups makes modern life unprecedentedly dangerous: convicts, child molesters, illegal immigrants. Any attempt to dismantle this nastily Manichaean worldview, in which the forces of good can clearly identify and oppose the forces of evil, is to be applauded.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/11/news-isis-syria-headlines-violence-steven-pinker\">Now for the good news: things really are getting better | Steven Pinker</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The risk of this optimistic account lies in reducing past eras to swamps of barbaric violence from which we have crawled, and which we can now regard with enlightened serenity, tut-tutting at the bad behaviour exhibited on the duelling field or the rugby pitch. Sharpe strains to avoid this patronising approach to the past, beginning with two substantial chapters on the middle ages that explicitly seek to overturn “the lazy stereotype of ‘medieval savagery’”. Similarly, in the chapters on modern attitudes that close the book, Sharpe acknowledges “how fragile and inconsistent our retreat from violence has been”, offering a thorough account of the anxieties fuelled by violent books, films, and computer games.</p> <p>By contrast, the thematically organised chapters in the middle of the book tend to sprawl and drift. They are packed with gripping anecdotes intended to “point up what violence has felt like and meant at specific times in our history”, but the recurrent story of a progressive reduction of violence becomes repetitious and under-explained. Sharpe adopts the account of a “civilising process” developed by the historian <a href=\"http://www.norberteliasfoundation.nl/\" title=\"\">Norbert Elias</a>, and though he eventually subjects it to bracing scrutiny – describing it as neither “inexorable nor inevitable” – it tends to serve as an explanatory catch-all in these central chapters, underpinned by quite general accounts of social change. Rather too many potted biographies and plot summaries begin to clog up the narrative, and Sharpe discusses forms of action such as slander and libel, which lie beyond his initial intent to focus only on physical violence or its direct threat. These chapters risk becoming a baggier history of English crime and social change.</p> <p>Despite this meandering mid-section, Sharpe is a humane and clear-eyed guide to a series of intractable and timely questions. No book on this topic could be comprehensive, but perhaps the most surprising omission is substantial discussion of terrorism, which is touched upon only briefly: the 2005 London bombings aren’t mentioned at all. Surely no other form of violence better captures its complex modern role: both the changed methods of human brutality, and the way in which fears and perceptions can create political realities of their own. In 2012, an <a href=\"https://terrorismlegislationreviewer.independent.gov.uk/report-on-the-terrorism-acts-in-2011/report-terrorism-acts-2011/?view=Binary\" title=\"\">independent report</a> concluded

Accordingly, Hersey decided to focus his narrative on the lives of a few chosen Hiroshima witnesses. As soon as he reached the ravaged city, he found six survivors of the bombing whose personal narratives captured the horror of the tragedy from the awful moment of the explosion. This gave Hersey his opening sentence, a unique point of view, and a narrative thread through a chaotic and overwhelming mass of material. In a style later developed and popularised by the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/New-Journalism\" title=\"\">“new journalism”</a> of the 1960s, the opening of Hiroshima pitches the reader into the heart of the story, from the viewpoint of one of its victims:</p> <p>At exactly 15 minutes past eight in the morning on 6 August, 1945, Japanese time, at the moment when the atomic bomb flashed above Hiroshima, Miss Toshiko Sasaki, a clerk in the personnel department of the East Asia Tin Works, had just sat down at her place in the plant office and was turning her head to speak to the girl at the next desk.</p> <p>From here, Hersey embarks on an exploration of the lives of five other interlocutors: the Rev Mr Kiyoshi Tanimoto, of the Hiroshima Methodist church, who suffers radiation sickness; Mrs Hatsuyo Nakamura, a widow with three children; one European, Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge, a German Jesuit priest who had endured exposure to radiation; and finally, two doctors – Masakazu Fujii and Terufumi Sasaki (not related to Miss Sasaki). Some of these interviewees had been less than 1,500 yards (1,370m) from the site of the explosion, and their harrowing accounts of vaporised, burnt and mutilated bodies, of blasted survivors, of hot winds and a devastated city tormented by raging fires, a scene from hell, gave a voice to a people with whom the US and its allies had been brutally at war only a year earlier. Hersey’s brilliant reportage gave his story an existential dimension:</p> <blockquote> They still wonder why they lived when so many others died. Each of them counts many small items of chance or volition – a step taken in time, a decision to go indoors, catching one streetcar instead of the next – that spared him. And now each knows that in the act of survival he lived a dozen lives and saw more death than he ever thought he would see. At the time, none of them knew anything. <br /> </blockquote> <p>Hersey also used all his skill as a novelist and as a war reporter to bring home the horror of what he, one of the first correspondents into Hiroshima, had learned:</p> <blockquote> Dr Sasaki had not looked outside the hospital all day; the scene inside was so terrible and so compelling that it had not occurred to him to ask any questions about what had happened beyond the windows and doors. Ceilings and partitions had fallen; plaster, dust, blood, and vomit were everywhere. Patients were dying by the hundreds, but there was nobody to carry away the corpses. Some of the hospital staff distributed biscuits and rice balls, but the charnel-house smell was so strong that few were hungry. By three o’clock the next morning, after nineteen hours of his gruesome work, Dr Sasaki was incapable of dressing another wound. <br /> </blockquote> <p>Hersey’s decision to use the testaments of Dr Sasaki, Mrs Namakura and the others, was both an inspired creative and also a tactically brilliant decision. The US army of occupation had prevented many US journalists from taking material out of the country, censoring photographs and tape-recordings alike. Hersey avoided such restrictions. He would stay only a few weeks in Hiroshima, but he returned to New York with a suitcase full of extraordinary first-hand material, and now set about fashioning a four-part piece for the <em>New Yorker</em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d76f515256a4394a207ad775e5603151e6c8ac6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d76f515256a4394a207ad775e5603151e6c8ac6e/0_0_300_435/300.jpg\" alt=\"Hiroshima by John Hersey, which has never been out of print since it was first published in 1946.\" width=\"300\" height=\"435\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hiroshima by John Hersey, which has never been out of print since it was first published in 1946.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Part I, A Noiseless Flash, introduced Hersey’s six witnesses. Part II, The Fire, reported the immediate, horrific aftermath of the explosion. Part III, Details are Being Investigated, described the wider, Japanese response to this unimaginable act of war. Part IV, Panic Grass and Feverfew, followed Father Kleinsorge and the sufferings of Hersey’s other witnesses in the weeks after the bombing, describing the Japanese people’s hatred for the Americans who had perpetrated this “war crime”. So soon after the end of the second world war, with feelings still running high, to achieve any kind of objectivity was a remarkable challenge.</p> <p>In hindsight, Hersey frankly acknowledged the first technical difficulty he encountered with this story: there was no way he could bring his usual style to bear on his material, he said. “A show of passion would have brought me into the story as a mediator. I wanted to avoid such mediation, so the reader’s experience would be as direct as possible.” Instead, he went for cool and low key. As the <em>New Yorker</em> writer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrik_Hertzberg\" title=\"\">Hendrik Herzberg</a> has written: “Hersey’s reporting was so meticulous, his sentences and paragraphs were so clear, calm and restrained, that the horror of the story he had to tell came through all the more chillingly.” Hersey’s flat, plain, deliberately unemotional style immediately caught the imagination of his editors, Ross and Shawn. In conditions of great secrecy, they decided to do something unprecedented: devote an entire edition of their magazine to the story of Hiroshima.</p> <p>The ironic cover of the 31 August 1946 edition of<em> </em>the <em>New Yorker</em> gives nothing away: a summer-in-the-park illustration of a carefree picnic. It was not until the reader turned past Goings on About Town and the usual metropolitan advertisements for motor cars and diamonds that the editors’ intentions were revealed in a simple statement: “TO OUR READERS. The <em>New Yorker</em> this week devotes its entire editorial space to an article on the almost complete obliteration of a city by one atomic bomb, and what happened to the people of that city. It does so in the conviction that few of us have yet comprehended the all but incredible destructive power of this weapon, and that everyone might well take time to consider the terrible implications of its use.”</p> <p>The impact of this <em>New Yorker </em>was extraordinary. The edition sold out 300,000 copies within hours of publication, inspiring a storm of commentary across the US, and abroad, especially on radio. Harold Ross said he had never got “as much satisfaction out of anything else” in his life. Hersey’s piece was reprinted worldwide. Albert Einstein, an outspoken opponent of the bomb, who tried to buy a thousand copies of the <em>New Yorker</em> to send to fellow scientists, had to settle for a facsimile version. Copies of the original edition changed hands at many times the cover price.</p> <p>The <em>New Yorker</em>’s rival, <em>Time</em> magazine, gave the best immediate verdict:</p> <blockquote> Every American who has permitted himself to make jokes about atom bombs, or who has come to regard them as just one sensational phenomenon that can now be accepted as part of civilisation, like the airplane and the gasoline engine, or who has allowed himself to speculate as to what we might do with them if we were forced into another war, ought to read Mr Hersey. When this magazine article appears in book form the critics will say that it is in its fashion a classic. But it is rather more than that. </blockquote> <p>Within a year, Knopf had published Hiroshima as a book. It has never since been out of print, and has now sold upwards of 3m copies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/23/hiroshima-john-hersey-bomb-new-yorker-1946-enduring-reportage-rachel-cooke-shelf-life\">Hiroshima by John Hersey: an enduring memory of reportage</a> </p> </aside>  <p>John Hersey returned to Hiroshima in 1985 to meet his informants once again, and to write a retrospective, The Aftermath, which described the postwar lives of the <em>hibakusha</em>*. Mr Tanimoto, he wrote, still “got up at six every morning and took an hour’s walk with his small woolly dog, Chiko. He was slowing down a bit.

The class of people to whom Hersey’s witnesses belonged came to be called by the more neutral name hibakusha – literally, “explosion-affected persons”. For more than a decade after the bombings, the hibakusha lived in an economic limbo, apparently because the Japanese government did not want to find itself saddled with anything like moral responsibility for heinous acts of the victorious US.</em></p> <h2>A signature sentence<br /></h2> <p>“In the street, the first thing he saw was a squad of soldiers who had been burrowing into the hillside opposite, making one of the thousands of dugouts in which the Japanese apparently intended to resist invasion, hill by hill, life for life; the soldiers were coming out of the hole, where they should have been safe, and blood was running from their heads, chests, and backs.” Page 10</p> <h2>Three to compare<br /></h2> <p>John Hersey: A Bell for Adano (1945)<br />John Hersey: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Algiers_Motel_Incident\" title=\"\">The Algiers Motel Incident</a> (1968)<br /><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/04/my-hero-jonathan-schell-david-hare\" title=\"\">Jonathan Schell</a>: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fate_of_the_Earth\" title=\"\">The Fate of the Earth</a> (1982)</p>","wordcount":"1734","commentCloseDate":"2016-10-11T23:28:00Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/52aj3","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/642bce81bb49ec43849612df71194fb0cca6d35a/0_128_4632_2779/500.jpg"},"tags":[{"id":"books/series/100-best-nonfiction-books-of-all-time","type":"series","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"100 Best Nonfiction Books of All Time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/series/100-best-nonfiction-books-of-all-time","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/series/100-best-nonfiction-books-of-all-time","references":[],"description":"Robert McCrum's guide to the 100 greatest nonfiction books in English."},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"books/history","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"History","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/history","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/history","references":[]},{"id":"books/essays","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Essays","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/essays","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/essays","references":[]},{"id":"world/nuclear-weapons","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Nuclear weapons","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/nuclear-weapons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/nuclear-weapons","references":[]},{"id":"books/journalism","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Journalism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/journalism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/journalism","references":[]},{"id":"world/japan","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Japan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/japan","references":[]},{"id":"world/secondworldwar","type":"keyword","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webTitle":"Second world war","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/secondworldwar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/secondworldwar","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","type":"tone","webTitle":"Features","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/observer-new-review","type":"tracking","webTitle":"Observer New Review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/observer-new-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/observer-new-review","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/robertmccrum","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Robert McCrum","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/robertmccrum","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/robertmccrum","references":[],"bio":"<p>Robert McCrum is an associate editor of the <a href=\"http://observer.guardian.co.uk/\">Observer</a>.

should not pass without mention of his charming dual-language 1993 book for children <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17558456-the-tunnel\" title=\"\">Le Tunnel/The Tunnel</a>. Celebrating the completion of the boring of the Channel Tunnel, this follows its progress, albeit in a fictionalised world, and through the efforts of two small and appealing creatures, an English and a French mole. It is ingeniously illustrated by Wildsmith and translated by Anne-Marie Dalmais. Drawings of fantastic and humorous boring machines and a rudimentary and cumbersome early computer pepper its pages. Technorat and le Rat-Bureaucrate evaluate a variety of curious and unlikely calculations. Many of the cross-sectional illustrations feature the White Cliffs, while <em>drôle</em> queues of traffic wend their way across the pages to the ports. Each page has lively description in French and English and catches the optimism and thrill of the tunnel breakthrough. How sad that the decline in foreign-language teaching in recent times would deprive youngsters today of the enjoyment of much of this enchanting tale. <br /><strong>Miriam Stocks </strong><br /><em>Kirkby Lonsdale, Cumbria</em></p>","wordcount":"172","commentable":"false","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/53tcd","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/76660378262fba6258233672e4b1f499b218c4c8/0_200_4800_2880/500.jpg"},"tags":[{"id":"books/teen-books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Teen books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/teen-books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/teen-books","references":[]},{"id":"books/booksforchildrenandteenagers","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Children and teenagers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksforchildrenandteenagers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksforchildrenandteenagers","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"artanddesign/illustration","type":"keyword","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webTitle":"Illustration","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/illustration","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/illustration","references":[]},{"id":"artanddesign/artanddesign","type":"keyword","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webTitle":"Art and design","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/artanddesign","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/artanddesign","references":[]},{"id":"tone/letters","type":"tone","webTitle":"Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/letters","references":[]},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-letters-and-leader-writers","type":"tracking","webTitle":"UK Letters and Leader Writers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-letters-and-leader-writers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-letters-and-leader-writers","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[],"description":"All the latest from the world's leading liberal voice."},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webTitle":"Main section","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/editorialsandreply","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webTitle":"Editorials & reply","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/editorialsandreply","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/editorialsandreply","references":[]}],"elements":[{"id":"76660378262fba6258233672e4b1f499b218c4c8","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"https://media.guim.co.uk/76660378262fba6258233672e4b1f499b218c4c8/0_200_4800_2880/2000.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"A Eurotunnel train entering into a freight tunnel.","caption":"A Eurotunnel train entering into a freight tunnel.

Not to be just yet, for hanging upside down inside my mother with my head pressed against her pelvis while getting repeatedly battered by Claude’s cock thrusting inside her isn’t what I call a meaningful existence. It’s enough to give a foetus a migraine. My mum is up to something. I’m sure of it. I can hear her plotting with Claude. As you may have guessed Claude is not my father. I’d recognise his cock anywhere. The shame of it.<br /></p> <blockquote> <p>“O that this too unsolid flesh would melt.”</p> </blockquote> <p>They’re drinking again. If I’m going to get another hangover then I’d prefer a Chateau Elsinore rather than a cheap Sancerre. Claude and Trudy do a lot of drinking. Too much I’d say. Sometimes I think she isn’t the slightest bit bothered about me. I’ll give her a kick to remind her.</p> <p>“The baby’s kicking again,” says Trudy.</p> <p>“Not long now. We’ll soon be rid of it.” That’s Claude. “So here’s the plan. We invite my brother round for a drink and put some anti-freeze in a smoothie. Once he’s croaked I’ll get to keep the St John’s Wood house and we’ll be £7m to the good.”</p> <p>My brother! That means Claude must be my uncle. That’s disgusting. God! What a piece of work is a man. And a woman for that matter. I’ve got to think of a way of putting an end to this.</p> <blockquote> <p>“I’ll bide my time until vile Claude be pissed <br />And passed out in Trudy’s incestuous bed.”<br /></p> </blockquote> <p>Let me tell you a bit about my dad. He’s called John. Yeah, I know you thought he was going to be called Ham but we’ve all had a few nasty surprises lately. So John writes and publishes poetry which basically means he’s broke. Apart from the St John’s Wood house which he inherited. And is now about to lose, along with his life if I’ve heard correctly. I really ought to do something about it.</p> <blockquote> <p>“If I were man enough, I’d take revenge. <br />Though p’raps tis best to give myself a break <br />For I still lack sufficient evidence.”<br /></p> </blockquote> <p>The place is a dump. Trudy’s a complete slob. I don’t want to blame her too much as she’s only 28. She got married far too young and isn’t ready to settle down. Still, I do think she could make a bit of an effort for my arrival. She could get the Norwegian cleaners in.</p> <p>There’s a ring on the doorbell. It’s my father with another woman.</p> <p>“Hi Trudy,” he says. “This is Elodie. She’s a poet and we’re planning to get married. Don’t come over all surprised. I’ve known about you and Claude for a while. I’m sure you’ll be very happy together. So here’s the deal. You’ve got a month to get out of the house. I’ll be over tomorrow to sort out the details.”</p> <p>What? My father’s got a girlfriend? I’m pretty sure that was never in the script. Everyone’s started to ad lib badly here. Nor did he even mention what was going to happen to me. Neither of them seem to want me. No wonder I’m having an existential crisis before I’m even born.</p> <blockquote> <p>“Or could it be that I o’er think my life <br />And take my torment far too personally <br />From too much thought doth little action come <br />Thus conscience makes cowards of us all. <br />So man up, foetus, get thyself stuck in <br />Remember this: I think, therefore I am.”<br /></p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"309f2921f355c83285921e9c9cf8d31fd59db2a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/309f2921f355c83285921e9c9cf8d31fd59db2a5/0_0_1763_2550/691.jpg\" alt=\"Nutshell book cover by Ian McEwan for digested read\" width=\"691\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>To cut a short story shorter. Claude and Trudy fucked and got pissed, before Claude went off to mix up the anti-freeze. The next day John came round and I’m moving and kicking as best I can to make Trudy think twice about offing him. No joy, Claude sneaks up and tips the poison in his ear. Just kidding. I shout ‘Don’t drink it’ but no one hears. Next thing I know there’s a news item saying he’s been found dead on the M1. How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable seem to me all the uses of this world!</p> <p>The police have come round. They haven’t arrested them yet but they don’t seem to be buying the suicide story. Can’t say I blame them. They’re getting pissed and fucking again. I’ve got a headache and bruises all over me. I’ve had enough, I’m going to hang myself with the umbilical cord.</p> <blockquote> <p>“And when I die, make sure the whole world knows <br />I was a decent bloke for the most part.”<br /></p> </blockquote> <p>I couldn’t go through with it. Claude and Trudy are planning to do a runner. They’re going to dump me. God, I don’t want to be alone in exile in Poland. I must do something.</p> <blockquote> <p>“Get off thy butt, foetus! From this time forth <br />My thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth.”<br /></p> </blockquote> <p>“Oh my God,” yells Trudy. “I’m giving birth.”</p> <p>I just need to hang on till the police arrive. The rest is silence.</p> <p><strong>Digested read, digested:</strong> In utero veritas.<br /></p>","wordcount":"898","commentCloseDate":"2016-09-21T16:00:22Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/539pm","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a9df94c5eb2454a56c7af775f8b117d307cc7ea/532_157_2028_1217/500.jpg"},"tags":[{"id":"books/ianmcewan","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Ian McEwan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/ianmcewan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/ianmcewan","references":[]},{"id":"books/series/digestedread","type":"series","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Digested read","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/series/digestedread","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/series/digestedread","references":[],"description":"John Crace’s incisive pastiches of the most popular writers, from Bridget Jones to Julian Barnes"},{"id":"books/fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Fiction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","type":"tracking","webTitle":"UK Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-culture","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","type":"tone","webTitle":"Features","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"profile/johncrace","type":"contributor","webTitle":"John Crace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/johncrace","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/johncrace","references":[],"bio":"<p>John Crace is the Guardian's parliamentary sketch writer and author of I Never Promised You a Rose Garden.

Flood","body":"<p>Ella Mills, aka <a href=\"http://deliciouslyella.com/\">Deliciously Ella</a>, urges us to whip up sweet potato brownies and zucchini noodles with avocado cream, and to embrace the joys of nut butters and coconut oils, in our quest to #eatclean and achieve “better health, glowing skin and boundless energy”.</p> <p>Bella Younger, aka <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/deliciouslystella/?hl=en\">Deliciously Stella</a>, has a different approach for those who want to #gettheglow. Her breakfast smoothie features green food colouring and apple liqueur because “dyeing things green automatically makes them look healthy”. Her summery fruit salad is packed with foam bananas, gummy strawberries and sour cherries - “This fruit salad is so easy, it takes almost no effort to make” - and her raw vegan burger consists of a handful of coconut mushrooms and marshmallow fluff in a roll.

She came across the clean-eating phenomenon, headed by the likes of Mills, Alice Liveing, aka <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/clean_eating_alice/?hl=en\">Clean Eating Alice</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.hemsleyandhemsley.com/\">Hemsley sisters</a> (#TheArtOfEatingWell, #GoodAndSimple). “I spent an afternoon on Instagram, looking at the hashtag eatclean – I couldn’t believe how many handstands there were, and how there could be so many avocados in the world,” she says. Her boss challenged her to start her own version, and she came back after the weekend with her Deliciously Stella parody, and 25 followers on Instagram.</p> <p>Younger was also an aspiring comedian, and was writing a show for the Edinburgh festival at the time. (“It was called Champagne Socialist – about how I come from a Tory political dynasty, but I’m quite left wing, and how disgusted my family are with that, and how hard I tried to be cool and lefty, but I have a posh voice and everything went wrong.”) She had unexpectedly landed an hour-long slot, having only performed a handful of five-minute gigs before, and “was a bit worried no one would come and see it. I thought if I get [Deliciously Stella] on Facebook, maybe I won’t perform to an empty room.”</p> <p>So she “spent a lot of time stalking people [on Instagram] and leaving cringy emojis – clean-eating people, famous people, people who used the same hashtags” to get them interested in Deliciously Stella, and eventually Davina McCall took note. McCall’s attention brought Deliciously Stella 1,000 followers; today she has 131,000 and a just-published book, in which she “shares the #cleaneating life hacks she swears by to achieve a #strongnotskinny look and a #blessed outlook on life”.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A normal person can't eat [the clean-eating way] and do everything they need to do. And it's incredibly expensive</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Whether this is “indulgent truffle strawghetti”, which substitutes strawberry laces for spaghetti (“arrange them into four piles in four bowls; you should aim for a swirl formation”), or avocado and eggs on toast three ways, using gummy, Creme or scotch eggs (“getting your eggs to look perfect can be tricky but once you know these easy life hacks you’ll never look back”), it’s a welcome parody of the ubiquitous clean-eating fanaticism.</p> <p>“It’s everywhere – you can’t avoid it. And I just think a lot of it is rooted in bad science. I’m surprised people haven’t questioned it more. Everyone has rushed to give up gluten and I think it doesn’t make sense. I’ve got no problem with anyone who wants to eat more vegetables or exercise more, but it gets to an extreme and it’s so restrictive,” says Younger, 28, who has now given up her job in television to concentrate on comedy full time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/may/17/queens-of-greens-healthy-food-tastes-great\">The queens of greens: the new wave of cooks proving healthy food can taste great</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“I personally found it made me feel a bit rubbish about myself – it’s the unrealistic expectations put on women. That we can get up at six, work out for two hours, have a kale whatever, and then also manage to do a desk job. When you look at someone like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2016/jun/13/gisele-bundchen-model-book-reissue-cheaper-mario-testino-juergen-teller?page=with%3Aimg-4\">Gisele</a>, you know she looks that way because it’s her job. But for a normal person, you can’t eat and exercise like that and do everything else you need to do. And it’s incredibly expensive.</p> <p>“I don’t mind the idea of spiralised vegetables, but replacing a complex carbohydrate with spiralised vegetables is madness. It’s not pasta, it’s not going to fill you up. Also cauliflower pizza is so depressing. Things like that make me a bit sad.

caravan,” reads one postcard with a picture of a bucolic scene on the front. “Weather good so far.” The Twitter account Postcard From The Past (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/pastpostcard\">@PastPostcard</a>) has been delighting its quickly amassed 22,000 followers with glimpses of people’s long-ago holidays.

He had collected postcards as a child but had the idea to put them on Twitter with a snippet from the writer’s message, alongside the postcard’s image. “I began to realise that with a bit of careful selection, these very ordinary cards could have quite weird, wonderful and entertaining messages on them. They are little snapshots of people’s lives – what concerns someone enough to write it down at a cafe table and send it off? Also, I think it’s quite nostalgic – postcards have fallen out of people’s holiday routine to a large extent.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a07a74c94ec245cba01a4f5a18d3da2b748a3162\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a07a74c94ec245cba01a4f5a18d3da2b748a3162/0_0_1646_1050/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘Baby beautiful, like Richard.’\" width=\"1000\" height=\"638\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Baby beautiful, like Richard.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @pastpostcard</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jackson has thousands of postcards he is working through, but uses about only one in 20. He started looking at Edwardian postcards but found the writing really difficult to decipher, and they felt historic, not nostalgic. He was more interested in the mass-tourism cards from the 60s, 70s and 80s. The names are of an age, too. There are Barrys and Bernards; Wendys and Sues. A tourist in Teignmouth writes: “Room has bath, shower, telephone, radio, telly, hairdryer &amp; teamaker plus electric clock.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a076b2bdf7789ca9d81d98ac1f8ae0d79ab2b00b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a076b2bdf7789ca9d81d98ac1f8ae0d79ab2b00b/0_0_1234_1737/710.jpg\" alt=\"‘Everyone in Paris looks like Oliver Reed.’\" width=\"710\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Everyone in Paris looks like Oliver Reed.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @pastpostcard</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What common themes emerge? “The weather is an absolute obsession. People often talk about how they’re eating well because the cards come from the time when people didn’t eat out very much, except on holiday.” One postcard, from York, relays the news: “Have had scotch eggs &amp; salad, very nice, and fruit trifle, cup of tea. Very nice chips with the salad.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a49537e8179de0fc690b97fc28245577d043263\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a49537e8179de0fc690b97fc28245577d043263/0_0_1800_1216/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘We’re sunning and swimming from morn till night.

The other thing he has noticed, says Jackson, “is how cheerful people are. I don’t know if it’s because they’re writing cards to show everyone what a good time they’re having on holiday, but they’ll say something like: ‘It’s pouring with rain but we’re having a great time.’ There’s a lesson to learn about the British character there.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a48fd98ce7935f41423130b562de5bf8cefbd08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a48fd98ce7935f41423130b562de5bf8cefbd08/0_0_1651_1039/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘Been out today buying umbrellas.’\" width=\"1000\" height=\"629\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Been out today buying umbrellas.’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @pastpostcard</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It’s the mysteries I like. “I do hope you haven’t had any washing go missing,” writes someone on holiday in the Lake District. A recent favourite of Jackson’s read, poetically: “We drive past where I was before” with an image of a volcanic, green landscape. “I don’t quite know what to make of that,” he says. “I think it means driving past somewhere they had stayed before, but it feels like it has a message of life in it.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\"

Trevor’s early career spanned <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.co.uk/publishers/cornerstone/hutchinson/\" title=\"\">Hutchinson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.co.uk/publishers/penguin-general/hamish-hamilton/\" title=\"\">Hamish Hamilton</a>, <a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Collins</a>, <a href=\"http://www.carltonbooks.co.uk/imprints/andredeutsch\" title=\"\">Andre Deutsch</a>, <a href=\"http://www.methuen.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Methuen</a>, <a href=\"https://www.hodder.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Hodder</a>, <a href=\"https://www.orionbooks.co.uk/Weidenfeld-and-Nicolson/Index.page\" title=\"\">Weidenfeld</a> and <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.co.uk/publishers/transworld/bantam-press/\" title=\"\">Bantam Press</a>. In 1986 he joined Random House (then Century Hutchinson) and represented that company in north London and East Anglia until his retirement, winning the <a href=\"https://www.waterstones.com/\" title=\"\">Waterstones</a> Rep of the Year award in 2012.</p> <p>Trevor was a tireless champion for both fiction and non-fiction, a friend to numerous authors and a great supporter of independent bookshops and booksellers.</p> <p>He was born in Upminster, east London, the only child of Dorothy (nee Link) and Eric Moore. Dorothy died when Trevor was still a child and his father, a civil servant, later remarried a teacher from Trevor’s school, bringing step-siblings to the family. Trevor undertook his national service with the RAF, and he credited running the recreational library at Kenley in Surrey while still in service with igniting his passion for books and reading.</p> <p>A first marriage to Anne Jenner in his 20s ended in divorce, and in his early 40s Trevor met and fell in love with Pam Valdar, marrying after a whirlwind romance. Trevor became a much-loved friend to Pam’s son Andy and daughter Sarah, and a co-carer and parent for her daughter Kate.</p> <p>Kate died in 2002, and Pam in 2007. After Pam’s death Trevor went on to renew an early friendship with Elsa, an old colleague, and found love again. In recent years he frequently visited Elsa in her native Argentina and also fell in love with that country and their way of life – the tangos, the music and in particular the wine and beefsteaks.</p> <p>Trevor’s other great passions included his beloved Suffolk – especially its country pubs and local produce – as well as jazz and classical music and playing bowls. He was an enthusiastic and excellent cook and a connoisseur of fine wines, a superb mimic and an irrepressible raconteur.</p> <p>Elsa survives him.</p>","wordcount":"345","commentable":"false","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/53hdx"},"tags":[{"id":"books/publishing","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Publishing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/publishing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/publishing","references":[]},{"id":"tone/obituaries","type":"tone","webTitle":"Obituaries","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/obituaries","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/obituaries","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/series/otherlives","type":"series","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webTitle":"Other lives","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/series/otherlives","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/series/otherlives","references":[],"description":"Obituaries pages traditionally describe and celebrate the lives of the great and good, the famous and infamous.

href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/21/did-you-ever-have-family-bill-clegg-review\" title=\"\"><em>Did You Ever Have a Family</em></a>, begins with a scene of almost unimaginable tragedy: on the eve of her daughter’s wedding, a fire breaks out in June Reid’s house, killing her daughter, prospective son-in-law, partner and ex-husband. Unable to bear the loss – or the stifling atmosphere of the small community in which she lives – June heads for a coastal motel once visited by her daughter, where she tries to piece together the stories of the lives that have been lost.</p> <p>What follows is a beautiful, heart-rending novel of quiet, understated tragedy, dissecting the relationships between parents and children, friends and lovers, neighbours and strangers.</p> <p>Told from multiple perspectives, Clegg’s novel creates a rich tapestry of characters whose lives intersect around the fire. Clegg weaves their stories delicately, teasing out their connections with subtlety and authenticity, so that revelations are all the more shocking for their unexpectedness. This is a novel in which there are no secondary characters: every individual possesses their own, distinctive voice.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/13/bill-clegg-interview-did-you-ever-have-a-family-booker\">Bill Clegg: ‘I really understand the loneliness, excitement and vulnerability it takes to create a book now’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As well as being a study of love and loss, <em>Did You Ever Have a Family</em> is a skilful deconstruction of the preconceptions, gossip and judgments rife in small communities. June’s former neighbours create their own narratives about both the cause of the fire and the private lives of its victims, in a searing indictment of small-town prejudices. As such, the novel is as much a commentary on storytelling as it is on grief; on the tales people tell themselves and one another to make events fit into their own narrow worldview.</p> <p>Ultimately, <em>Did You Ever Have a Family</em> is sensitive and insightful, heartbreaking and hopeful. Clegg has a perceptive understanding of the tribulations of parenthood and the transitory nature of relationships: “None of these people were ever hers. They either belonged to someone else or had lives or lies that put them out of reach, or should have.”</p> <p>Near the beginning of the novel, a gossiping local woman comments on the fire: “How do you recover from that? How would you even begin?” In this tender, wise and hopeful novel, Clegg begins to answer that question.</p> <p><em>Did You Ever Have a Family is published by Vintage (£8.99). </em><a

Coetzee’s engaging new novel sets passion against rationality but are we missing some deeper meaning?","byline":"Alex Preston","body":"<p>JM Coetzee is my favourite living author. I need to say this at the outset to offer some context to the battle I fought with <em>The Schooldays of Jesus</em>, his 13th novel. I spent three happy years writing my PhD on Coetzee, and my love for his early work survived meeting the man in person (like a wet weekend in Grimsby) and a run of several baffling “novels” (since his Man Booker-winning <em>Disgrace </em>in 1999) which seemed bent on stripping away all of the satisfactions we look for in fiction.</p> <p><em>The Schooldays of Jesus</em> follows on the heels of its predecessor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/02/childhood-of-jesus-jm-coetzee-review\" title=\"\"><em>The Childhood of Jesus</em></a>. In that novel, we met Davíd and Simón, arriving memory-less in a Spanish-speaking city named Novilla. Novilla was a vast refugee camp operated on the most enlightened and benevolent lines – people were fed, housed and found employment; children were educated (although Davíd fought all attempts to make him conform). With a subtle touch, Coetzee conveyed how sinister the passionless world of Novilla was, where humans were treated as objects to be measured, ordered and controlled. As Simón put it: “You know how the system works. The names we use are the names we were given there, but we might just as well have been given numbers. Numbers, names – they are equally arbitrary, equally unimportant.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Might Coetzee be coming to recognise that the asceticism of his own style has backed him into a narrative corner?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Eventually, Simón, Davíd and Davíd’s mother, Inés, fled Novilla, heading for a town called Estrella. It is here that we pick up the story in the second novel in the series, with Simón and Inés arguing over how best to educate the six-year-old Davíd. Finally, after the intercession of three wealthy sisters, Davíd is sent to the local Academy of Dance, run by a Juan Sebastián Arroyo and his elegant wife, Ana Magdalena (many of the names in the book are obscurely significant). The education at the Academy is unusual – students learn maths by “dancing down” numbers – and yet Davíd, who’s a precocious and exasperating child, appears to flourish, forming a particularly close bond with Ana Magdalena.</p> <p>Estrella is as blandly well-meaning as Novilla before it. The front page of the town’s newspaper features “an elderly couple with a gigantic cucurbit from their garden. It weighs fourteen kilograms, says the report, breaking the previous record by almost a kilogram. On page two a crime report lists the theft of a lawnmower from a shed (unlocked) and vandalism at a public toilet (a washbasin smashed)”. Against this banal backdrop, a real crime takes place. Dmitri, a creepy guard at the town’s museum, murders Ana Magdalena. It is Davíd who finds the body.</p> <p>If <em>The Childhood of Jesus</em> was about Davíd leading Simón to a point where he could no longer endure the smothering goodwill of the state, this novel finds Simón questioning the extent to which his own internal landscape has been resculpted by the stultifying amiability of his adopted land. He attends Dmitri’s trial, where the judges do everything they can to mitigate the offence, leaving the murderer raving in the dock, assuring them of his genuine ill will. In Dmitri, Simón finds a model for real feeling. When the judges ask for a recess in order for the suspect to cool down, Simón has the first of a series of revelations. “Allow our passions to cool, he thinks: what passion do I feel except a passion of irritation?”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/10/100-best-novels-disgrace-jm-coetzee-intensely-human\">The 100 best novels: No 99 – Disgrace by JM Coetzee (1999)</a> </p> </aside>  <p><em>The Schooldays of Jesus</em> is delivered in language stripped of all ornament and affect. There are few metaphors, little description, nothing lovely to snag the mind as we move forward through the story. There is, though, the regular clang of cliche: Simón knows the city “like the back of his hand”; the news of Dmitri’s relationship with Ana Magdalena “will spread like wildfire”; the three sisters greet Simón “stony-faced”. The prose, as we have come to expect from Coetzee, is not the point. And yet when Simón starts to attend a writing class, it is the austerity of his own language that brings home to him how devoid of real feeling his life has become. “Dmitri has on several occasions ridiculed the way I speak, which strikes him as overly cool and rational,” he writes. “Dmitri believes that the style reveals the man… he would call me a passionless man.” In the light of this new self-knowledge, he resolves to change. “I want to become a different person.”</p> <p>Is it too much to think that Coetzee might be coming to recognise that the asceticism of his own style has backed him into a narrative corner? In the final, moving passage of the novel, in which Simón rejects the biopolitical world embodied by the philosopher Metros, who believes “everything in the universe can be measured”, and instead embraces dancing until “bliss washes over him”, do we detect a slight thawing in the emotional atmosphere? Coetzee was never a writer of obvious warmth, and yet his best novels – <em>Waiting for the Barbarians</em>, <em>Life &amp; Times of Michael K</em>, and <em>Disgrace</em> – were luminous with feeling, often profoundly affecting.</p> <p>I tried for a long time to force some sort of meaning into the “mesmerising allegorical tale” that its blurb suggests <em>The Schooldays of Jesus</em> to be. In the end, though, I came back to a fine 2004 essay by <a href=\"http://www.york.ac.uk/english/our-staff/derek-attridge/\" title=\"\">Derek Attridge</a> in which he proposes a non-allegorical reading of <em>Waiting for the Barbarians</em>. Attridge is clear about his intention, disliking “the urge to allegoricise Coetzee”, which he believes is “rooted in the formidable power of this traditional trope to make sense of texts that, for one reason or another, are puzzling at face value”. Attridge’s attempt to overthrow the allegorical mode, which he calls “engaged reading”, seeks to “preserve the event as an event”, allowing a book to achieve its impact without treating it as a mystery to be solved. <em>The Schooldays of Jesus</em> is, when read in this fashion, obscurely compelling, often very funny, full of sudden depths. Not all novels are like Magic Eye diagrams, which, if you stare at them hard enough, will reveal their hidden meanings. <em>The Schooldays of Jesus</em> is a work of many small but significant truths, rather than one central message; a novel stubbornly committed to its own way of doing things. I confess to a distinct twinge of disappointment when I saw that it had not made the Man Booker shortlist.</p> <p><em>The Schooldays of Jesus is published by Harvill Secker (£17.99). </em><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/schooldays-of-jesus.html\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to buy it for £14.75</em></a><em> </em></p>","wordcount":"1132","commentCloseDate":"2016-10-09T06:45:00Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/52kyg","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bb113a395f706da1d53b9345336580f1ac63e79/46_4_5135_3081/500.jpg"},"tags":[{"id":"books/jmcoetzee","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"JM Coetzee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jmcoetzee","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/jmcoetzee","references":[]},{"id":"books/fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Fiction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/observer-new-review","type":"tracking","webTitle":"Observer New Review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/observer-new-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tracking/commissioningdesk/observer-new-review","references":[]},{"id":"tone/reviews","type":"tone","webTitle":"Reviews","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/reviews","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/reviews","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/alex-preston","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Alex Preston","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/alex-preston","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/alex-preston","references":[],"bio":"<p>Alex Preston is an award-winning author and journalist.

He later attended the Guildhall School of Music and Drama and was a member of the National Youth Theatre. After a number of theatre roles he made his film debut in <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em> (1981) as the ill-fated guide Satipo; since then he has starred in more than 70 films including <em>Chocolat</em>, <em>Boogie Nights</em>, <em>Magnolia</em> and <em>Frida</em>.

They were doing some of his plays in a fisherman’s shack on the beach, and water was coming up under the floorboards. It’s a comprehensive biography. The previously unpublished stuff is fascinating, including on O’Neill’s drinking and the circuitous route he took to become a playwright. It makes you realise his plays are very autobiographical, particularly the later ones, which was a real eye-opener. It’s what made his plays so dense and so rich, I think.</p> <h2>2 | Museum</h2> <p><a href=\"http://massmoca.org/\" title=\"\"><strong>Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art</strong></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c315d2256f3238a54fb2eaa7b35bbff38574daa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c315d2256f3238a54fb2eaa7b35bbff38574daa/0_27_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"Mass MoCA – Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art in North Adams.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mass MoCA – Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art in North Adams.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is in a small town called North Adams, which used to be a mill town. When the industry went away all these mills and warehouses were empty, and there’s a gentrification process going on. One of the first things to move in was the Museum of Contemporary Art. They bought this huge factory building and have turned it into a fantastic art collection, filled with Rothkos and Pollocks. They’ve managed to preserve the integrity of the original building; very much like Tate Modern in London, it still looks like what it was originally, but inside there’s this feast of contemporary art. I’ve been twice, there’s so much to take in – you need time, and good museums are always worth revisiting anyway.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0164a3f53ea41b7c46849c7b22746b4436cc0814\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0164a3f53ea41b7c46849c7b22746b4436cc0814/0_14_600_851/353.jpg\" alt=\"Alan Furst A hero in France\" width=\"353\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alan Furst: A Hero in France</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: W&amp;N</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>3 | Novel</h2> <p><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/hero-in-france.html\" title=\"\"><strong>A Hero in France by Alan Furst (2016)</strong></a></p> <p>I encountered Furst when I saw <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/polish-officer.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Polish Officer</em></a> on someone’s desk and got curious. <em>A Hero in France</em> is a novel about the resistance in Paris at the beginning of the second world war. Furst creates these fantastic pictures: the detail about the smells and sounds and feel of walking along cobbled streets in the dark, and the noise it makes, clattering and echoing. He has fantastically rich and varied characters. He catches speech patterns very accurately, so you’re completely in there. I’ve got a soft spot for spy novels.

I’ve been listening to this guy a lot recently. He’s not a brand-new artist – his first album came out in 2009 – but he’s new to me and he’s really fantastic. Like a magpie, he’s taken all these flavours and influences from different genres and mashed them all up with a wonderful new, modern sensibility in terms of the lyrical content and the way he sings. You listen to one album and think, “That sounds a bit like Hall &amp; Oates,” or “That sounds a bit like Otis Redding.” It’s really interesting. His album <em>Man About Town</em> is really fantastic.</p> <h2>5 | Play</h2> <p><a href=\"http://wtfestival.org/main-events/an-american-daughter/\" title=\"\"><strong>An American Daughter at Williamstown theatre festival</strong></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b5192f05552d89b7490dc73a79aff8bc1cec94bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b5192f05552d89b7490dc73a79aff8bc1cec94bc/308_86_4336_2602/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An American Daughter by Wendy Wasserstein at Williamstown theatre festival.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An American Daughter by Wendy Wasserstein at Williamstown theatre festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: T Charles Erickson Photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is the last play I saw. It was a revival of a play by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/feb/01/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" title=\"\">Wendy Wasserstein</a>, which is about 20 years old, about a woman who has been appointed surgeon general, and how the media and people in her family sabotage her professional chances. The play asks “Can a woman really have it all? Can she have a career and a family?” It’s interesting, 20 years ago this was a very hot topic, and I think it still is. It’s very prescient and timely, especially when we’ve got Hillary Clinton hopefully about to become the first female president of the United States.</p> <h2>6 | Film</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3IONdE15vQ\" title=\"\"><strong>All About Eve (directed by Joseph L Mankiewicz, 1950)</strong></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f2b061c2946417c0511d20a9b65a494e5641dad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f2b061c2946417c0511d20a9b65a494e5641dad/259_162_1619_971/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bette Davis, Marilyln Monroe and George Sanders in All About Eve.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bette Davis, Marilyln Monroe and George Sanders in All About Eve.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/20th Century Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I’d never seen this before, and it’s one of those movies you always hear about. It’s about the corrosive quality of ambition and how it can kill you; it’s a wonderful morality tale about its dangers. An older actress who is still at the prime of her career befriends a younger actress who seems to want to learn everything she can, but turns out to be incredibly ambitious and prepared to do almost anything to take her place. It’s a great movie in terms of the pressures that female actors particularly are under when it comes to getting older. It’s a pressure men don’t feel in the same way.</p> <h2>7 | Restaurant</h2> <p><a href=\"http://cheebo.com/new/\" title=\"\"><strong>Cheebo, Los Angeles</strong></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54f529b0d3e38861fc799fdce4260a3e30842d3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54f529b0d3e38861fc799fdce4260a3e30842d3d/0_0_2000_1339/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cheebo pasta and pizza restaurant in Los Angeles.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"670\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cheebo pasta and pizza restaurant in Los Angeles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ricardo DeAratanha/LA Times via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is my favourite restaurant in LA, right on Sunset Boulevard. It’s a funky, unpretentious place with a great little menu. It’s kind of European with an American twist; they do great pastas and pizza but they’ve also got things like omelettes and breakfasts. I discovered it in 2007 when I was getting ready to leave for a big job in Europe, and I was packing and treated myself to a really nice lunch there. I couldn’t wait to get back and I’ve been a regular customer since. I donated a painting to them a few years ago. It feels a little bit like someone’s back room; it’s got that kind of feel.</p>","wordcount":"1013","commentCloseDate":"2016-10-09T07:00:00Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/52ade","thumbnail":"https://media.guim.co.uk/78fd6d934e6078ebe44b6dac1f7ede3f89e8b291/1437_258_3023_1814/500.jpg"},"tags":[{"id":"film/alfred-molina","type":"keyword","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webTitle":"Alfred

to a former political journalist","byline":"Rachel Cooke","body":"<p>Robert Harris’s gripping new novel, <em>Conclave</em>, has a contemporary setting, in the sense that the year is 2016, or thereabouts. But in another way, it’s not contemporary at all. The action takes place over 72 hours inside the Vatican, where the cardinals are sequestered to elect a new pope in a secretive process that dates from the 13th century. In charge of their various ballots – again and again they must vote, the idea being that with each round, one candidate grows ever stronger until, well, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habemus_Papam\"><em>habemus papam</em></a> – is Lomeli, the dean of the College of Cardinals. Lomeli is a good and holy man, but he is suffering a crisis of faith, finding it hard to pray, a situation that is hardly helped by the revelations that now begin to unspool around him and threaten to derail the election altogether. Who will win? Only God knows. At first, it is a three-horse race between Cardinal Adeyemi, whose victory would make him the first African pope; Cardinal Tredesco, a seething, outspoken Italian with traditional views; and Cardinal Tremblay, an ambitious but bland Canadian. But then, from nowhere, new candidates emerge, one of whom is, much to his horror, Cardinal Lomeli.</p> <p>As it happens, <em>Conclave</em>’s author has a somewhat pontifical air himself, and I mean this in the best sense of that word, because he is about the least pompous famous writer I’ve ever met. Amiable, wise and pink-cheeked, with the same taste for the finer things we have witnessed in certain popes – let us remember <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2013/mar/03/pope-benedict-true-legacy-fashion-sense\">Benedict’s red leather loafers</a> – it’s all but impossible, once you’ve read his new novel, not to imagine how fabulous he would look in a white <a href=\"http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2016/04/28/popes-zucchetto-sold-for-12500-in-50-per-cent-price-drop/\">zucchetto</a>, with a cape to match, and a socking great ring on his finger for journalists to kiss as they try desperately not to reveal the sin of envy in his presence (before he was a million-selling novelist, Harris was a hack just like them – and me). Not that he is a Catholic, or even a believer. “Though I’d be careful about mocking God,” he says, when we meet for lunch at a Bloomsbury hotel close to where he is attending a workshop for a possible theatre adaptation of one of his books (he has steak and chips, and three glasses of wine). “He is quite a character in the book, because I knew from the start that these cardinals would believe in God as we believe in electricity. But really, I just love politics in all its forms, and this is the oldest election in the world, and the most mysterious. I’ve been intrigued by it for years.”</p> <p>His research for the book began with the Gospels, which he read again, very fast, for the first time in 40 years. “They unfold like a novel, and such a character emerges: a radical, quite tricky and contradictory figure, but still, a human being. It is a religion founded on love and charity, and my cardinals genuinely try to lead that life. But what fascinates me are the inevitable distortions and corruptions of the institution. You go in attempting to be good, but of course you soon lose sight of yourself, because no one monitors themselves constantly. And then there comes the enormous wealth, the architectural beauty, the privilege, and the whole thing starts to buckle.” The Vatican, he says, was surprisingly helpful, responding positively to his request – sent via his Italian publisher – for a private tour of the city. This enabled him to see the places he describes so vividly in his book: the Casa Santa Marta, the hall of residence-like building, staffed by nuns, where the cardinals bunk down during the conclave; the Pauline Chapel, with its two frescoes by Michelangelo, where they attend a sermon before withdrawing to the Sistine Chapel to vote; and the Sacristy, where the new pope is robed. Is the Casa Santa Marta as strange as it sounds in <em>Conclave</em>? “It does have a slightly weird atmosphere, yes. I spoke to one person who’d stayed there, who checked after a night because it felt too much like a private clinic.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Unless the old electoral college is reintroduced, I think the Labour party is gone and we just have to accept that</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As the world waits for white smoke to rise above the Vatican, the cardinals must know nothing of what is happening elsewhere. They are sealed off entirely. In <em>Conclave</em>, however, the outside world does permeate their holy seclusion. Lomeli, without giving too much away, has no choice but to consider both radical Islam, and the question of the ordination of women, even as the cardinals do their work. Does Harris think his novel will prove controversial, at least with some Catholics? “I don’t know. I do think the church is resolving its contradictions at the moment thanks to the personality of a remarkable pope. But there are greater difficulties ahead. Its attitude towards the ordination of women isn’t, I think, sustainable – and the rise of Islam highlights those anomalies in the Catholic church by mirroring them, to a degree.” For Harris, the persecution of Christians in the Middle East is also “one of the great untold stories”, for which reason, he made a central character in <em>Conclave</em> the archbishop of Baghdad: “Before Blair and Bush, there were 1.5 million Christians living relatively safely in Iraq. Now we’re down to 250,000, living in a state of siege.”</p> <p><em>Conclave</em>, Harris’s 11th novel, wasn’t an easy book to write, but it was a fairly fast one. It took just seven months. “When I was younger, there would be long gaps between books: three years, five years. But after <em>Pompeii</em> [which came out in 2003] something changed, and now I really like to be starting work on a new book before the last one is out. I’m at my most contented when I am writing. But it also distances me from the publication of the one that’s coming out.” It isn’t the reviews that he dislikes, so much as the whole business of publication. “Just as people who go blind are said to have more acute hearing, so I think that if, over 25 years, you become a writer, the aspect of privacy and living in your own head becomes very developed. It’s not that I’m shy or retiring. It’s just that I like the equanimity of living in my own zone.” He is suspicious of literary festivals, for all that he can pull in the crowds. “It works against you. They see you, and so they don’t buy the book. And with fiction, I don’t really know why you would necessarily want to hear the voice of the novelist; it gets in the way. It’s quite important that the voice in the reader’s head is neutral. One of the great strokes of luck for Orwell is that no recording of his high-pitched Etonian voice exists, and so this incredibly clear, modern, classless voice comes through in his writing.” His own voice is not neutral. Reassuringly (to me, at any rate), he still sounds like he comes from Nottinghamshire.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f747336d87aee13075339704c2ce1dd169c9bac0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f747336d87aee13075339704c2ce1dd169c9bac0/0_15_3192_1916/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Miranda Richardson and Rutger Hauer in the 1994 film version of Fatherland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Miranda Richardson and Rutger Hauer in the 1994 film version of Fatherland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sportsphoto/Allstar/MGM</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But we should talk about politics, shouldn’t we, before we get to his roots? <em>Conclave</em> might well be set in a realm even more bitchy and anachronistic than that of the Palace of Westminster, but with its unbudging binaries – the cardinals are either liberal or not – and its talk of schism, not to mention the role pride and envy play in proceedings, it brings to mind nothing so much as Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party, which, as all the world knows, is shortly to announce the result of its very own election.</p> <p>“Oh, God,” he says, pretending to throw his head into his hands (Harris, a former political editor of the <em>Observer</em>, has made no secret <a href=\"https://twitter.com/robert___harris\">on social media</a> and elsewhere of his opposition to Corbyn). “One is having to revise one’s views. I basically think, now, that MPs should elect the leader [of the Labour party] just as the cardinals elect the pope. I started to think it after Ed Miliband won. Everything that has gone wrong with British politics this year – and an awful lot has gone wrong – has been to do with getting away from parliamentary democracy. There has always been an admirable tension between the demands of the wider electorate and their representatives, [with] their conscience and judgment, and from between the two comes something valuable. This throwing of things glibly open to one member, one vote is a disaster. It’s true of the referendum, and it’s true of the Labour electoral system.”</p> <p>His smile is wry. “In my old age, I find I’m a Burkeian conservative, a believer in the power of institutions. It’s counterintuitive that widening the franchise can be harmful for democracy, but I think it can be. One should not try to mix two different systems. That’s the moral of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/18/dictator-robert-harris-review-cicero-remarkable\">my Cicero novels</a>. Mess around with your constitution, and it will fall to pieces. So now we arrive at a situation where the government and the political establishment is struggling to put through the most colossal about-turn for 70 years, an about-turn in which it does not really believe; and where Labour MPs know that their leader is not up to it, that he can’t form a government or even hold one to account, but are being dictated to by outside forces. It will end in tears.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When history is written, Blair will be seen to have played a large part in what has happened to Labour</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>How should the parliamentary Labour party respond to Corbyn’s inevitable victory? “I don’t think, in the foreseeable future, there’s any way of removing him – and if he were to be followed by John McDonnell [the shadow chancellor], Corbyn might, in any case, look like the golden era. I saw an interview with McDonnell the other day in which he was asked: what are the four writers who have influenced you most? And he said: Marx, Lenin, Trotsky, and Rosa Luxemburg. You couldn’t make it up, could you?” He hoots with derisive laughter. “No, unless the old electoral college is reintroduced [under that system, individual members represented a third of votes, the same as the PLP and the unions], I think the party is gone and we just have to accept that. My view – although I know none of them want to confront it because it’s such an emotionally shattering trauma – is that there is a case for the PLP to elect its own leader, and form its own shadow cabinet. The point is that they [the Corbynites] don’t play by rules the rest of us would recognise. They genuinely believe purity is the most important thing. Well, that’s fine. But go and start your own party, don’t take over one of the great instruments for social progress in this country. It’s immoral.”</p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p>On Twitter, Harris has occasionally mentioned his background when debating these matters. “Council- house-born. Comprehensive school-educated. Voted Foot, Kinnock. But not for private-school apologists for IRA and Stalin,” he said, when Seumas Milne was appointed the party’s communications director almost a year ago. This isn’t, however, just another manifestation of the competitive prole-ier than thou speak that trails so many opinions in our media – by which I mean that it’s not even remotely an effort to disguise or distract from his current privilege. The point is: Harris thinks of himself as having been, from childhood, deeply lucky. “I was fortunate to have been born into working-class family where books were valued and you were the centre of your parents’ lives. There was never any doubt that you were important. I’ve been so blessed. I left university before they got rid of grants, I left Cambridge before <a href=\"http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/blf10/links/structuralism.html\">structuralism</a> took over, I left the BBC before John Birt took over, I left Fleet Street before that all collapsed, and I started writing novels before the supermarkets took over. I feel like Buster Keaton, the flats falling behind me every time I close a door.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/mar/12/cardinals-mass-pope-video\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/3ecpj\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"1879327\"            data-video-name=\"Cardinals attend final mass before choosing new pope - video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/3/12/1363106781025/Cardinals-012.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-405461470\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/3/12/1363106781025/Cardinals-012.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2013/3/12/130312PopeMass-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2013/3/12/130312PopeMass-720.mp4\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2013/3/12/130312PopeMass_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/130312PopeMass/130312PopeMass.m3u8\"/><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2013/3/12/130312PopeMass_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/mar/12/cardinals-mass-pope-video\">Cardinals attend final mass before choosing new pope</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>His father was a printer who loved to read. “When I was nine, he stayed up all night reading Arnold Bennett’s <em>Clayhanger</em>. He read Greene, Lawrence, Joyce, and he did it all on his own dime. The last conversation I ever had with him was about <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hitler-Stalin-Parallel-Alan-Bullock/dp/0006863744\">Alan Bullock’s joint life of Hitler and Stalin</a>, which I’d given him. He’d read every page of it. He left school at 14, but he had a rich intellectual life.”</p> <p>Harris’s parents would take him and his sister to museums, and encouraged them to watch interesting documentaries on TV, but there was no pressure, no hothousing. “You see so many people who have been broken by their expectations having been forced on them.” His background was a bond he shared with Roy Jenkins, with whom he enjoyed a “great, late friendship… Roy’s father was a miner who had gone to Ruskin College [in Oxford; it specialises in adult education]. He’d done six months in Paris before the first war, and he had this row of classics – Zola, Balzac – and they were all in French.”</p> <p>Harris took to Cambridge (where he read English) “immediately”, a response he traced back to his time at comprehensive school. “I was like Sergeant Bilko. I mean I had my own office, with a phone, and there wasn’t a school council, so I set one up and made sure I was head of it, and I did a school paper. It was bizarre! <em>Rushmore</em> [a comedy by Wes Anderson about an eccentric teenager] is one of my favourite films – because the boy in <em>Rushmore</em> was me!” So Cambridge, land of the swot and the, erm, weirdo, was perfect? “Yes. I loved it. My first Saturday, I went to the student newspaper [he ended up editing it], and I got involved with the union, and before I was even 20 I had met all these cabinet ministers and John le Carré.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3dfaf9acf2ce4920d5b67c1d9c19ce517b9b713e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3dfaf9acf2ce4920d5b67c1d9c19ce517b9b713e/0_172_4256_2555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pierce Brosnan as Blair-ish former prime minister Adam Lang in Roman Polanski’s film adaption of Robert Harris’s The Ghost.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pierce Brosnan as Blair-ish former prime minister Adam Lang in Roman Polanski’s film adaption of Robert Harris’s The Ghost.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Snap Stills/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After university, he didn’t fancy going back to the provinces, which meant that, thanks to Fleet Street union rules, his only option was to join the BBC (he’d known from the age of eight that he wanted to write). This, then, he duly did, working as a reporter on <em>Newsnight</em> and <em>Panorama</em>. “But by 28 or 29, I’d got as far as I was going to go. I was never going to be a presenter. So when I was asked if I would be interested in being political editor of the <em>Observer</em>, well, I knew that it was going to be tough, but at that age, you have enough guts to do it.” Later on, having resigned in protest at a long-forgotten office coup too complicated to go into here, Andrew Neil, then the editor of the <em>Sunday Times</em>, rang him and offered him more money than he was earning at the <em>Observer</em> full time to write a column one day a week. Things like that, I tell him, possibly a bit sullenly, just don’t happen any more. “Oh, I know,” he says soothingly. “I have children going out into the world.” (He is married to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2013/may/19/gill-hornby-hive-interview\">Gill Hornby</a>, sister of Nick, and now a novelist herself; they have four children.)</p> <p>Column writing was, he insists, the hardest job he has ever done, the deadline squatting over his week like a toad. As he tells it, he had to psych himself up like a prize fighter. But never mind, lightning was about to strike. On the days he wasn’t trying to work up an opinion, he began writing a novel that asked the question: what if the Nazis had won the war? This became <em>Fatherland</em>, for which the hardback rights went for £500,000, and the paperback for more than £1m. As a result, he was able to buy the swanky vicarage in a Berkshire village that he still lives in. He also has a house in the south of France, and drives an Aston Martin. In our current climate, there’s something rather old-fashioned about this (JK Rowling and Paula Hawkins apart). It makes me think of Arnold Bennett, whose novels financed the purchasing of yachts, or Somerset Maugham, who retired to a villa in Cap Ferrat. And like both of them, he is a very good if perhaps underrated writer (by which I mean that it’s easy for literary types to be snobbish about novels that read so smoothly), his imagination always turning outwards, where it fixes with apparent ease on some extraordinary new subject. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/17/robert-harris-fear-index-review\">The financial crisis</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/sep/30/fiction.features3\">ghost-writing</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/02/officer-spy-review-dreyfus-affair-robert-harris\">Dreyfus</a>: he has tackled them all.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/09/robert-harris-imperium-why-i-write-political-fiction\">Robert Harris: why I write political fiction</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It’s time he was going, though I must say he’s looking rather comfortable on the hotel sofa by now. Before he does, though, I have to ask about Tony Blair, with whom he was once friendly – in 1997, Blair invited Harris to join him on the campaign trail – but with whom he later fell out after Blair sacked Harris’s old friend Peter Mandelson for the second time. What, I wonder, did he make of Blair’s response to the Chilcot inquiry, which took the form of a two-hour press conference? “Oddly enough, someone who sees him asked what I thought he should do, and I said, if I were him, I would call the press into a room and I’d say ‘ask me anything, and I won’t leave until your questions are exhausted’. I don’t know if that was fed back to him or not.</p> <p>“In one sense, I’m reluctant to talk about him – it looks like I’m obsessed, and I’m not. I liked Tony very much, and in many ways, even though I haven’t seen him for a decade, I still do. But I think when passions have cooled and history is written, he will be seen to have played a large part in what has happened to Labour and the exit from Europe. A whole promising strand of political thought was sort of trashed and destroyed, not so much by the Iraq war, as by his subsequent behaviour. If he had said at any point, ‘I did what I felt was right, but it has not proved to be wise, and I regret it,’ he could have moved on from there. But when he says, after Chilcot, I still think it [the war] was the right decision… well, that’s wrong, and then you think everything must have been wrong. It’s like <a href=\"https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/a_p_herberts_misleading_cases/\"><em>AP Herbert’s Misleading Cases</em></a><em>.</em>” He puts on a pedantic funny voice: “That is the 13th chime of the clock, which renders suspect the 12 chimes that have gone before.”</p> <p>In his eyes, however, the real disaster is that Iraq, and Blair’s deluded attitude to it, has only encouraged the repudiation of Labour’s years in government first by Ed Miliband, and then by Jeremy Corbyn – which brings us back to the church. “Labour ought to be trumpeting its triumphs,” he says. “My children go to the local state school, and it’s fantastic; my mother-in-law has been in the local hospital and it’s very good. Both were built under the watch of a Labour government. But now it’s all trashed by their own side. One thing I learned from the Catholic church is that, as Cardinal Newman said in the 19th century, you can change all doctrine so long as it doesn’t <em>contradict</em> anything that has gone before.” Like a priest delivering the last line of a particularly interesting sermon, his tone is firm but pastoral, the last two words falling on the ears like a blessing. “You cannot have a situation in which a political party repudiates all that has happened before. You destroy the institution. You have to absorb what was done, and move on.”</p> <p><em>Conclave is published by Cornerstone on 22 September (£20). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/conclave.html\"><em>Click here to

He writes for <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Haaretz</em></a> and other newspapers and lives in Tel Aviv.</p> <p><strong>This book looks at the second world war from the perspective of two characters, Sasha and Thomas, who collaborate with Stalin and Hitler respectively. What interested you about that subject?</strong><br />In Israel, the second world war and the Holocaust are something you grow up with. At school, in the army, you sometimes feel that the Holocaust is shoved down your throat. But in literature you tend to come across the usual character types: either the bureaucrats such as Eichmann, or the highly perverse caricature of a Nazi. In contrast, I wanted to look at the role of brilliant and creative people, kind of “free spirits”, who happened to find themselves living under those regimes. Sasha, for example, may not agree with the objectives of the NKVD, but working for them provides her first chance to shine, and an opportunity to realise her talents.</p> <p>Thomas has the cultural contempt for nazism that many bourgeois Germans had. But he sees the job offer from the Foreign Office as an opportunity to become a great man in Germany. He is not a coward: he takes major risks to achieve his goals.</p> <p>It interested me that in that situation, there would have to be a deal between the individual and the regime: the regime would get to use the individual’s talents, and in return the individual would get an opportunity for fulfilment. Both sides are both being used by, and using, the other.</p> <p><strong>Do you see any parallels with the moral dilemmas facing contemporary Israelis?</strong><br />I see parallels in every society. Those of us who live in capitalist societies often go out and work for corporations that contradict our political ideas. And then we come home and rant on Facebook or go out to a protest.</p> <p>In Israel it is very interesting how many people can function while working for organisations that totally contradict their personal beliefs. And I don’t mean that in a judgmental way, just to observe that literature can try to understand what that means, psychologically: how can we go out into the world and live within a society that we may consider to be unjust? It must involve a level of personal denial: in every case of genocide, you have a small group of people who actually commit the atrocities, and a great many other people who are greasing the genocide machine.</p> <p><strong>Was either Sasha or Thomas based on a real historical figure?</strong><br />I did a lot of historical research, obviously, but it was important to me that these characters and their precise roles were made up. Both of them have strange positions, as writers in the service of the regime. I wanted to give the reader a sense of having an imaginary journey within this historical landscape.</p> <p>So Thomas, for example, is inspired by Gatsby, and also by Ulrich, the protagonist of Robert Musil’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jun/17/featuresreviews.guardianreview28\" title=\"\"><em>The Man Without Qualities</em></a>.</p> <p><strong>One of the book’s strengths is its intimate portrayal of life in wartime Germany and Russia – it brings to life the daily chaos and terror of these turbulent societies. How did you research it?</strong><br />I read many books about the period, and testimonies of people who lived through it. But most importantly I travelled to many of the places mentioned in the book: Lublin, Warsaw and Brest-Litovsk. I needed to create the personal landscapes of Sasha and Thomas, to see what they would have seen when they woke up in the morning.</p> <p><strong>As I read the book, I was trying to work out to what extent the title is ironic…</strong><br />It is ironic! But you are right, I think the extent of the irony changes from chapter to chapter. Clearly, as a writer you allocate to your characters some of your own qualities, your background and memories. But I also wanted to maintain a certain distance from them, that was quite deliberate, and perhaps it is why some people have found the book cold. Sometimes I identified with them, and sometimes I felt repulsion for what they were doing. I don’t have things planned out from the beginning – I leave myself open to surprises and variations as I write.</p> <p><strong>This novel was published in Israel in 2010. What have you been working on since?</strong><br />My next book to be published in English will be a nonfiction book about Israel, <em>In a Land Without Borders.</em> I was very interested as someone who has long been involved in politics [Baram’s father and grandfather were both Israeli politicians] to go out and challenge my political beliefs against the reality of the West Bank.</p> <p><em>Good

The first is that I have an odd phone conversation with a publicist for his cookbook, in which she informs me that Wareing is keen for me to take a “fresh and new” approach, that he’s tired of everyone writing the same old stuff, and that he wants to talk about the future, not the past – a future, by the way, that doesn’t involve standing at a stove all day long.</p> <p>The second is that I receive an email from another publicist, this one at a company that does PR for Wareing’s restaurants. It begins by giving me directions, but soon segues into more of the same. She is, it seems, delighted I will offer a “fresh, new perspective” on her client, who these days is very happily able to spend much more time with his family.</p> <p>Well, you can imagine how all this goes down with me, and perhaps because I feel a bit grumpy about it, once I’m safely ensconced at a table at Marcus with Marcus – it’s 9.30am, which is good in the sense we have the place to ourselves, but bad in the sense there will be no veal sweetbreads or smoked Anjou pigeon for me today – I put this to him. “Your people have told me that it’s all change with you,” I say, confidently. And then, a bit less confidently, because I’ve seen the look on his face: “Apparently, you’re not in the kitchen any more. Apparently, you want to focus on other …” My voice, weedy now, trails off.</p> <p>There is a tiny silence, and then he replies. “That phrase: ‘not in the kitchen’. Let’s be clear. I run my company in my chef’s jacket. I am here, every day, standing at the pass. I watch, and I guide, and I taste. The difference is, I’m not on the kitchen side of the pass, sweating, breaking everyone’s balls. I’m at the other side now. Because I don’t want to be like some chefs, in their 50s and 60s still standing in the kitchen with a big hat on. I don’t want to do that. We don’t look at chefs who’ve done every single service and think that’s cool any more. In France they might do. But here, we don’t. My chef theory is that I have to allow my youth to grow underneath me. I’ve got three restaurants, and maybe one day, I’ll have four or five. But only if I’ve got the talent to do it. So I have to step to the side.”</p> <p>I’m taken aback by his tone, which is testy, almost affronted, even though, in the end, it seems he doesn’t really disagree with my proposition: he <em>isn’t</em> in the kitchen any more. But as I will discover, this is Wareing all over: defensive, even when on the receiving end of praise; hyper-alert to criticism, even when none is intended. Like an unattended pan, you feel he could boil over at any moment. His smile doesn’t always reach his eyes. Add to this the weird motivational manual he seems to have swallowed, whole and unseasoned (“I love business! I love LBC radio!”), plus his tendency to refer to himself in the third person (“The feedback was that Marcus doesn’t do sharing plates”), and the thought does occur that he is inordinately well named.</p> <p>The restaurant, which he relaunched in 2014, is cool and quiet, the only sound a waiter diligently ironing tablecloths. Which makes me think. Has Brexit had any effect on business? Wareing believes it will take a while – if, that is, there is to be any dip at all. “When I took over here in 2008, it was the start of the recession,” he says. “It took a year for it to impact. Corporate entertaining got strictly controlled, and private money was much more cautious about its spend ... Look, I’ll be honest. I voted to stay in. But I love the new government. Let them get on with it. You have to look at the positives. It’s new. It’s fresh.” At this point, I resist the temptation to say: just like you.</p> <p>All three of his restaurants – the other two are the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/may/21/gilbert-scott-london-nw1-review\">Gilbert Scott</a>, at St Pancras station, and Tredwell’s, a brasserie at Seven Dials, Covent Garden – are, he says, thriving. Tredwell’s, of course, initially had a bit of a thwacking from the critics though he feels these attacks were mostly personal.</p> <p>“There was one in particular … But I discarded it in my head. It’s only because you bring it up that I remember it, though quite frankly, I don’t give a shit.” Actually, this is unfair: he brought up the critics, not me. But since he has, does he feel any of the criticisms were justified? “What was being said was that Marcus can’t cook. Well, I can cook, and my team can cook.” All the same, he put his group operations director, Chantelle Nicholson, into the kitchen as chef-patron after the reviews. So things are smoother now? “Why? Do you think it’s failed?” No, but … “One thing that didn’t work out was the sharing plates. That made me realise how pigeonholed I am, how hard it is to break out of the mould of fine food. How come Hawksmoor can [serve sharing plates]? How come Jamie Oliver can?”</p> <p>Isn’t it great to be known for a certain kind of excellence? “Yes, but I want to diversify.” So he would, perhaps, like to roll out Tredwell’s? “Don’t <em>you</em> dream of things?” So he <em>does</em> want to roll it out? “No! It was only ever going to be one restaurant.”</p> <p>My god, this is tiring. But perhaps some part of him needs it: the constant tussle. We all remember his legal battles with Gordon Ramsay, skirmishes he has always claimed to have enjoyed (in 2008, they fought publicly over Petrus, the Berkeley having announced that Wareing would be taking on the lease of the two-Michelin-starred restaurant, of which he was then head chef; Ramsay eventually kept the name, but the row enabled his protege to escape what he described as his mentor’s “interference” in his kitchen, and go it alone by opening Marcus).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3a76c90f159515c8e6fc040ac76bf982fa78b80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3a76c90f159515c8e6fc040ac76bf982fa78b80/0_61_1552_931/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marcus Wareing with Gordon Ramsay in happier times.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In happier times with Gordon Ramsay.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Such pugnacity seems just to be another aspect of his extraordinary work ethic, a drive that was instilled in him by his father, a Southport fruit and veg merchant with whom Wareing used to work in school holidays – and one which he is now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/video/2013/may/10/marcus-wareing-chocolate-cake-video\">trying to develop in his older son</a>, 14-year-old Jake, who is in the kitchen today, prepping up. “I need to get him focused,” he says. “What we say to our kids is: if you don’t want to make the most of the opportunities in front of you, you’re more than welcome to go to a normal school, by which I mean a state school. The eight-hour day he’ll do today, you could add six hours on to that for me. I used to work with my father much longer days, so what I’m saying [to Jake] is: when you come out of your posh school, your blood is the same as mine, and it’s called work, mate.” Jake can be seen, along with his brother, Archie, and his sister, Jess, in Wareing’s undeniably excellent new cookbook, <em>Marcus at Home</em>, a volume he apparently struggled to write “because it’s at home and it’s being relaxed”. Luckily, his wife, Jane, was on hand to help: “I swear to God, her lasagne, her chillies, her curries are amazing.” Jane and he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/feb/13/tom-kerridge-angela-hartnett-recipes-marcus-wareing-skye-gyngell-hemsley-bruno-loubet\">share cooking duties</a> at home, and the family’s idea of fun is to gather round and judge their various offerings.</p> <p>They also love to eat out. “Do you know what the best thing that’s ever happened to me is?” he asks, suddenly enthusiastic. “The opening of the Ivy Cafe in Wimbledon. I love it. I can’t tell you. It’s great. I’m so happy. It’s so cool.” I pull a face. Isn’t it just another chain now? “Well, I’ve eaten at the Ivy since I came to London, and it’s the same as it was all those years ago when there was only one [the Ivy in Covent Garden, beloved of actors and celebrities]. Chips, dessert, bread, butter, service. It’s the standard bearer of quality food in Wimbledon!”</p> <p>Jane’s secret ingredient is, he insists, “love”, which may sound all the more hokey if you’ve seen <em>MasterChef: The Professionals</em>, a series that insists above all on precision and skill in the kitchen. Wareing, who trained under Anton Edelman, Albert Roux and finally under Ramsay at Aubergine, L’Oranger and then Petrus, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/dec/23/who-should-win-this-years-masterchef-the-professionals-final\">took over as a judge</a> on the show from Michel Roux in 2014, and is busy filming his third series. “Everyone thought I would be the last person who would get that gig,” he says. “You know: too hard, too driven, too unforgiving. Complete and utter crap, of course. I am a nice person.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd398970ce017997c7ababa21bd39cd5981fb285\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd398970ce017997c7ababa21bd39cd5981fb285/0_27_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"the MasterChef: The Professionals team (L-R) Gregg Wallace, Monica Galetti, Marcus Wareing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">the <em>MasterChef: The Professionals</em> team (L-R) Gregg Wallace, Monica Galetti, Marcus Wareing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Production/BBC/Shine</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Well, on the show, I say, you do seem encouraging, and relatively mellow … But … uh oh. I’ve fallen into yet another trap. “So you <em>did</em> judge me prior to the show. You read my media, and you have an opinion on me. But that is who I am on the telly. I do smile. Just don’t make me tell you [how to do something] 20 times. If I tell you that’s how I want it on the plate, and you ignore that again and again, that’s when it all starts to go to shit in the kitchen.”</p> <p>Does he like being on <em>MasterChef</em>? It seems that he does. What’s more, he won’t hear a word said against its presenter, Gregg Wallace. “I despise people who knock him. He’s got a heart as big as a rugby ball, he cracks lots of jokes, and he eats like a pig. No. NO! Don’t write that. I mean it. I will never talk to you again if you write that.”</p> <p>I think it’s time for me to push off now. But before I do, it’s my journalistic duty to ignore the warnings and ask Wareing, very briefly, about Gordon Ramsay. Have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/may/11/marcus-wareing-gordonramsay\">hatchets been buried</a>? Has his mentor been in touch to congratulate him? “On what?” On all that he’s achieved. “Why would he? Why do we have to bring Gordon into this? Why do you have to ruin things? He doesn’t even come into my head. I don’t even know if Petrus is still going.”</p> <p>Hmm. I’m not sure I believe this. But then, though I find out later that its doors do indeed remain open, at the moment he says it, I’m not sure whether Petrus is still around, either. Who can be said to have won the long and bloody Ramsay-Wareing war? In my mind at least, I guess Wareing did.</p> <h2><em>Marcus at home: the recipes</em></h2> <h2>Harissa-glazed aubergine with coconut and peanuts</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9699104eaba7a7cac277bc5b71ccbfd32474a7a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9699104eaba7a7cac277bc5b71ccbfd32474a7a6/0_801_1937_1162/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harissa-glazed auberginewith coconut and peanuts.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harissa-glazed aubergine with coconut and peanuts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Gregson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Aubergines absorb flavours really well. They do release a lot of liquid when cooked, though, so it’s important to chargrill the slices until really golden, otherwise the additional flavours will become diluted when serving.</p> <p>Serves 4<br /><strong>aubergines</strong> 2<br /><strong>olive or rapeseed oil</strong> 3 tbsp<br /><strong>flaked sea salt</strong> 1 tsp, plus extra<br /><strong>dairy-free coconut yogurt</strong> 150g<br /><strong>lime</strong> grated zest and juice of 1<br /><strong>rose harissa</strong> 50g<br /><strong>agave syrup</strong> 30g<br /><strong>lemon juice</strong> 1 tsp<br /><strong>roasted and salted peanuts</strong> 75g, roughly chopped<br /><strong>red chilli</strong> ½-1, finely sliced<br /><strong>coriander cress or salad cress</strong></p> <p>Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6. Heat a chargrill pan until hot.</p> <p>Slice each aubergine lengthways into 6 long strips. Brush with the oil and season with the salt.</p> <p>Chargrill both sides of the aubergine slices until deep golden. You may need to do this in a couple of batches depending on the size of your pan.</p> <p>Transfer to a foil-lined baking tray and finish cooking in the oven for 15 minutes.</p> <p>Mix together the coconut yogurt, lime zest and juice, and a good pinch of salt. Set aside.</p> <p>Mix together the harissa, agave syrup, 4 teaspoons of water and lemon juice. Season with salt and when the aubergine is cooked, brush liberally over the top of each strip. Return to the oven for 5 minutes.</p> <p>To serve, place the aubergine slices on a large plate and dot the coconut yogurt around. Scatter over the peanuts, chilli and cress.</p> <h2>Wareing family lasagne</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41249cf823ca53fb2028a52fc98cdf21314a05d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41249cf823ca53fb2028a52fc98cdf21314a05d7/0_161_2669_1602/1000.jpg\" alt=\"wareing familylasagne\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wareing family lasagne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Gregson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I think every home needs a family lasagne recipe, and this is one that has developed and improved over the years until it has now become a staple in the Wareing household. It’s not a quick dish to make, so we will quite often double up the recipe and put one in the freezer. </p> <p>Serves 6-8<br /><strong>olive oil</strong> 1 tbsp<br /><strong>minced beef or lamb</strong> 1kg<br /><strong>onion</strong> 1 large, chopped<br /><strong>garlic</strong> 2 cloves, chopped<br /><strong>celery sticks</strong> 2, chopped<br /><strong>flaked sea salt</strong> 1 tsp<br /><strong>freshly ground black pepper</strong> ½ tsp<br /><strong>cayenne pepper</strong> ½ tsp<br /><strong>red wine</strong> 300ml<br /><strong>chopped tomatoes</strong> 2 × 400g tins<br /><strong>tomato ketchup</strong> 2 tbsp<br /><strong>tomato puree</strong> 2 tbsp<br /><strong>Worcestershire sauce</strong> 1 tbsp<br /><strong>brown sauce</strong> 1 tbsp<br /><strong>beef stock</strong> 500ml<br /><strong>bay leaves</strong> 3<br /><strong>thyme and rosemary</strong> 2 sprigs each<br /><strong>basil leaves</strong> a handful, chopped<br /><strong>dried egg lasagne</strong> 12-14 sheets<br /><strong>buffalo mozzarella</strong> 250g, sliced<br /><strong>cheddar cheese</strong> 100g, grated</p> <p>For the white sauce<br /><strong>milk</strong> 600ml<br /><strong>onion</strong> 1 small, peeled but left whole<br /><strong>cloves</strong> 10<br /><strong>bay leaf</strong> 1<br /><strong>butter</strong> 50g<br /><strong>plain flour</strong> 50g<br /><strong>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p> <p>To make the meat sauce, heat the olive oil in a large saucepan. Add the mince and fry to brown all over, breaking up any chunks with a wooden spoon. Stir in the onion, garlic and celery, and continue to fry until the onion softens. Season with the salt, black pepper and the cayenne pepper.</p> <p>Pour the wine into the pan and bring to the boil, allowing it to reduce completely. Stir in the tomatoes, ketchup, tomato puree, Worcestershire sauce, brown sauce, stock and herbs. Bring to a simmer, cover and cook gently for up to 1 hour.</p> <p>Once cooked, add a little more seasoning if you like and remove the bay leaves and thyme and rosemary sprigs. Meanwhile, make the white sauce. Put the milk in a small saucepan. Stud the onion with the cloves and add it to the milk along with the bay leaf. Gently bring to the boil over low heat. Remove from the heat and leave to infuse for a few minutes before removing the bay leaf and onion.</p> <p>Melt the butter in a saucepan and add the flour, salt and pepper. Cook over low heat for about 1 minute to get rid of the floury taste but avoid letting it brown. Add a ladle of the infused milk and stir to combine. Continue adding the milk a little at a time until you have a thick pouring sauce. Keep hot, over a low heat.</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 180C/gas mark 4. To assemble the lasagne, put a layer of meat sauce in the base of a large ovenproof dish (approximately 20cm x 20cm, 8cm deep). Sit a layer of pasta on top, pour over a layer of white sauce and dot with a few slices of mozzarella. Continue with the same process using three layers of pasta and finishing with a layer of white sauce and mozzarella. Finally, scatter with cheddar, sit the dish on a baking tray and bake for about 40 minutes, until the top is golden brown.</p> <h2>Chargrilled mackerel with sherry, piquillo peppers, cornichons and ricotta</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d29ed5ab3f54d5c34929dd42c524532b0f731e9e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d29ed5ab3f54d5c34929dd42c524532b0f731e9e/0_398_2002_1201/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chargrilled mackerel with sherry, piquillo peppers, cornichons and ricotta.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chargrilled mackerel with sherry, piquillo peppers, cornichons and ricotta.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Gregson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mackerel is a versatile fish that stands up to the fierce heat of the barbecue or grill. I’ve paired it here with tangy cornichons, sweet peppers and creamy ricotta – it’s a winner.</p> <p>Serves 4<br /><strong>ricotta cheese</strong> 100g<br /><strong>lemon</strong> grated zest of ½<br /><strong>piquillo peppers in oil </strong>160g, finely sliced<br /><strong>cornichons</strong> 40g, finely chopped<br /><strong>capers</strong> 40g, finely chopped<br /><strong>mint</strong> 6 leaves, finely chopped<br /><strong>flat leaf parsley</strong> 8 leaves, finely chopped<br /><strong>extra virgin olive oil </strong>2 tbsp<br /><strong>dry sherry</strong> 2 tbsp, plus 5 tsp extra<br /><strong>mackerel fillets</strong> 8, skin on<br /><strong>vegetable oil</strong> 2 tbsp<br /><strong>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p> <p>Mix together the ricotta and lemon zest and season with salt and pepper. Set aside.<br /></p> <p>Combine the peppers, cornichons, capers, mint, parsley, olive oil and 2 tablespoons of sherry. Season to taste and set aside.</p> <p>Heat a grill to its highest setting, or heat a barbecue until hot.</p> <p>Check the mackerel for pin bones and remove any you feel.</p> <p>Score the skin several times with the tip of a sharp knife to prevent curling when cooking.</p> <p>Brush both sides of the fish with vegetable oil and season with salt. Place under the grill or on a barbecue, cooking the skin side first, and douse with the 5 teaspoons of sherry as it cooks.</p> <p>When the skin is deeply golden and blistered, flip over to cook the flesh side for 1 minute, until just cooked through.</p> <p>Put the piquillo pepper mixture on a large platter or individual plates and sit the mackerel on top. Dot the lemon ricotta over the mackerel and serve.</p> <h2>Roast chicken with herb, pistachio and sourdough citrus stuffing</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18860bb6c93bbd57b280f26b0a472ed6447a3b88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18860bb6c93bbd57b280f26b0a472ed6447a3b88/0_60_800_480/500.jpg\" alt=\"Roast chicken with herb, pistachio and sourdough citrus stuffing\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roast chicken with herb, pistachio and sourdough citrus stuffing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Gregson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This may be labour intensive, but it’s more than worth it if you’ve got the time. Not only does this look impressive when carved into, it tastes out of this world.</p> <p>Serves 4-6<br /><strong>chicken</strong> 1 large<br /><strong>bay leaves</strong> 4<br /><strong>lemon</strong> ½ (use the stuffing zested lemon)<br /><strong>orange</strong> ½ (use the stuffing zested orange)<br /><strong>garlic</strong> 1 bulb, halved<br /><strong>olive oil </strong>for drizzling<br /><strong>white wine or sherry</strong> 100ml<br /><strong>chicken stock</strong> 750ml<br /><strong>cornflour</strong> 2 tbsp (optional)<br /><strong>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong></p> <p>For the stuffing<br /><strong>butter </strong>50g<br /><strong>onion </strong>1 small, finely chopped<br /><strong>celery stick </strong>1, finely chopped<br /><strong>garlic</strong> 2 cloves , finely chopped<br /><strong>sourdough</strong> 150g, crusts removed<br /><strong>pistachio nuts</strong> 150g<br /><strong>lemon</strong> finely grated zest of ½<br /><strong>orange</strong> finely grated zest of ½<br /><strong>celery salt</strong> 1 tsp<br /><strong>freshly ground black pepper</strong> 1 tsp<br /><strong>egg</strong> 1, beaten<br /><strong>tarragon</strong> ½ bunch, leaves finely chopped<br /><strong>flat-leaf parsley</strong> ½ bunch, leaves finely chopped<br /><strong>coriander</strong> ½ bunch, leaves finely chopped</p> <p>To make the stuffing, melt the butter in a frying pan over medium heat. Add the onion, celery and garlic and cook until softened but not coloured. Transfer to a large bowl to cool.</p> <p>Put the sourdough in a food processor and blitz until you have fine crumbs. Add to the bowl with the cooled onions. Blitz the pistachios until finely chopped and mix into the bowl with the lemon and orange zests, celery salt, pepper, egg and herbs.</p> <p>Slide your fingers between the chicken skin and breast flesh to create pockets. Press the stuffing under the skin, pressing and moving so that the mixture covers as much of the breast as possible. Stuff the rest into the neck end of the chicken and secure with a cocktail stick or two.</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6. Put the chicken in a roasting tray and stuff the bay leaves, lemon, orange and garlic into the bird’s cavity. Drizzle with oil and season well. Cook for 1 hour and 20 minutes, until the outside is golden. Test the chicken is cooked by inserting a skewer into the fattest part of the thigh, if the juices run clear it is done. Carefully remove the chicken from the tray (pour any juices from the cavity back into the tray), place on a board to rest for 10-15 minutes, covered loosely with foil.</p> <p>Put the roasting tray over high heat, add the white wine and stir with a wooden spoon to deglaze, loosening and incorporating any sediment from the bottom of the tray. Add the chicken stock and boil until the liquid has reduced to about 600ml. If you prefer a thicker sauce, mix the cornflour with 2 tablespoons of cold water to form a paste, and add this to the pan. Boil for a couple of minutes, whisking until thickened. Add a little more seasoning, if you like, and pour into a jug.</p> <p>Carve the chicken and spoon the stuffing from inside the neck and serve with gravy.</p> <h2>Forest fruit sorbet</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f73fe78144a5b1ca50c167292b40aee9f4da9214\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f73fe78144a5b1ca50c167292b40aee9f4da9214/0_326_2669_1602/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Forest fruit sorbet\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Forest fruit sorbet.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Gregson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This can be made all year round, using fresh berries in the summer months or frozen when fresh are out of season. </p> <p>Makes about 750ml<br /><strong>caster sugar</strong> 150g<br /><strong>rosemary</strong> 4 sprigs<br /><strong>fresh or frozen fruits of the forest (cherries, blackberries and blackcurrants)</strong> 450g, defrosted if frozen<br /><strong>meringue</strong> to serve</p> <p>Put the sugar, rosemary and 150ml of water in a medium saucepan and place over medium heat.

Thames…","byline":"Sean O'Hagan","body":"<p>Charles Dickens described it as “a deadly sewer” that “ebbed and flowed, in the place of a fine fresh river”, while TS Eliot imagined it as a “brown god – sullen, untamed and intractable”. For its biographer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/sep/16/historybooks.features1\">Peter Ackroyd,</a> it represented “an escape from the world”. The river Thames, as the documentary photographer Chloe Dewe Mathews notes, “is many things to many people”. Her new series, <em>Thames Log,</em> is the result of five years spent wandering the course of England’s longest river, “documenting encounters and happenings” from its source in rural Gloucester to its mouth in the Thames estuary near Southend-on-Sea.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fee3b96719e078ca2bc6fb411ebcb88771f63fef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fee3b96719e078ca2bc6fb411ebcb88771f63fef/0_0_3600_2880/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Putney Bridge, London, 11.45am   Treasure hunters scan the beach at low tide.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Putney Bridge, London, 11.45am. Chloe Dewe Mathews: ‘Mudlarks scan the beach for treasure at low tide. The use of metal detectors requires a licence and any objects of archeological interest must be handed in to the Museum of London.’</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dewe Mathews’s images of the Thames are, among other things, a contemporary inventory of the often surprising ways in which ordinary people use the river, from the mudlarks who scour its banks for Roman coins to the Hindus who gather there in devotion to Ganesh as they would gather at the Ganges. “I started thinking about the Thames when I finished a <a href=\"http://www.chloedewemathews.com/caspian/\">project about the Caspian Sea</a> back in 2011,” she says. “I’d just returned from a place where people have a complex ritual relationship to water, whether through their religious beliefs or in terms of the health-giving powers they attribute to it, and it seemed to me that most people in London seemed hardly aware of the river. I thought, ‘Why does nothing mysterious and ritualistic happen on the river in homogenised England?’ – but I soon realised I was mistaken.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0fc530413b5017e132640d2a76881533c04bf366\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0fc530413b5017e132640d2a76881533c04bf366/0_0_3600_2880/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oxford, 6:30pm: Members of the Oxford Pagan Circle performa river ritual.

In the countryside near Oxford, she encountered a trio of female pagan revellers who dance by the river amid swirling trails of incense smoke. At Tilbury, she befriended a group of ship-spotters, who log the vessels that pass through the docks. On London Bridge, she photographed rush-hour commuters walking to work in the shadow of the Shard, and an annual Anglican procession that culminates there with a wooden cross being thrown into the river. At Southend, where the river joins the sea, she found white-robed members of an African Pentecostal church performing full-immersion baptisms, and, in leafy Richmond, witnessed a busload of Hindu devotees from Dollis Hill watch a Ganesh idol being submerged in the waters.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/jun/29/chloe-dewe-mathews-shot-at-dawn-moving-photographic-memorial-first-world-war\">Chloe Dewe Mathews's Shot at Dawn: a moving photographic memorial</a> </p> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2edf73fa06b49085964545e2de996a0a984f06e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2edf73fa06b49085964545e2de996a0a984f06e2/0_0_3600_2880/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Southend, 3:30pm.

For <em>Caspian</em>, she walked around the Caspian Sea, through Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Turkmenistan. In 2014, her series <a href=\"http://www.chloedewemathews.com/shot-at-dawn/\"><em>Shot at Dawn</em></a> <em>– </em>in which she photographed the sites across France and Belgium where deserters were executed during the first world war – was included in the Conflict, Time, Photography exhibition at Tate Modern. <em>Thames Log </em>is a more personal journey along a river that ran by her childhood home in Hammersmith and that she crossed every day on her way to school.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eabf321d4e925d39868efd816c56b9c1a5484c5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eabf321d4e925d39868efd816c56b9c1a5484c5c/0_0_3600_2880/1000.jpg\" alt=\"London Bridge, 1.30pm A wooden cross floats downriver\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">London Bridge, 1.30pm Chloe Dewe Mathews: ‘A wooden cross floats downriver.

Most of what I photographed came from chatting to local people who live along the river.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f2f884cd4eb886974b1e1a089ab75c3b7529db7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f2f884cd4eb886974b1e1a089ab75c3b7529db7/0_0_3600_2880/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Southend, 6.45pm Day-trippers from east London perform Maghrib, the Islamic evening prayer on the promenade at Southend\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Southend, 6.45pm. Chloe Dewe Mathews: ‘Day-trippers from east London perform Maghrib, the Islamic evening prayer on the promenade at Southend.’</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The title of the series, <em>Thames Log</em>, came from the ship spotters at Tilbury, who “sit all day logging the continual stream of vessels passing through”. Like many who use the river, they keep a constant eye on the weather and on tide timetables – the Thames is tidal below Teddington Lock and high tide readings are recorded at London Bridge and posted online by the Port of London Authority. “I monitored the weather and the tide timetables every day when I was working,” says Dewe Mathews, “and when I exhibit the photographs, they have a log underneath showing the weather and the high and low water readings on that day.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e81b61504e25176fef173f4813450004dd5b8d60\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e81b61504e25176fef173f4813450004dd5b8d60/0_0_3600_2880/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lechlade, 6pm.

Chloe Dewe Mathews: ‘Druid Chris Parks rows his homemade coracle on the upper Thames. In 2010, he built the boat and rowed it from source to mouth of the river.

But people’s relationship to it changes constantly, just as the city and the countryside around it change. “People told me that they often saw coconut shells on the water and these turned out to be remnants of the Hindu ceremonies conducted on the river,” says Dewe Mathews. “I photographed a brightly coloured Hindu idol that had been washed up in Shoeburyness after 2,000 people had attended a ceremony for the elephant god. These are recent developments. The river is a constant but now it seems to be attracting people who see it as a mysterious presence or maybe as an antidote to the increasingly homogenised city. Their motivations are diverse, but all of them are drawn to the water’s edge by their fascination with the river.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f6ee87e9f25fc1a1c8c31d9a4197c78d34a540f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f6ee87e9f25fc1a1c8c31d9a4197c78d34a540f/0_0_3600_2880/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oxford, 5pm.

The parallels between Britain today and Germany in the 1920s may well make this a compelling moment to revisit those postwar German thinkers who gathered in what was known as the Frankfurt school for social research – something akin to a Marxist thinktank, though one whose policy papers and brilliant books fed future generations as much or more than their own.</p> <p>Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, Herbert Marcuse and Erich Fromm, together with the close, but formally unattached Walter Benjamin, and from the 1970s Jürgen Habermas, were the core constellation. With the rise to power of the Nazis, the school’s Frankfurt headquarters had to be abandoned. Double persecution, as Marxists and Jews, began in 1933. Adorno, a brilliant musician as well as theorist, went to Oxford first to study with Gilbert Ryle. The school itself moved briefly to Switzerland and then the US, settling in what novelist Thomas Mann called “German California”. Despite their unchanged stance on capitalism, some of them were recruited for wartime intelligence work in the battle against the Nazi regime.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Marcuse held out some hope and stepped into the fray. During the Vietnam war, he took on the mantle of a cultural hero</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Between them they married Freud to Marx, then largely gave up hope, after the failure of the German uprising in 1918, of a revolutionary working class, and drew on Marx, Kant and Hegel to engage in a rigorous critique of capitalism and its technocratic systems. Crucially, they emphasised the ways in which consumerism and mass culture – from film to TV to pop music – lull us into a pleasant enough ideological slumber. It is thanks to the Frankfurt school that all aspects of culture are seriously studied today.</p> <p>Adorno and Horkheimer’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/08/frankfurt-school-dialectic-of-enlightenment\" title=\"\"><em>The Dialectic of Enlightenment </em></a>(1944) marked an early dismantling of the myth of progress and its concomitant exaltation of reason, while Adorno’s <em>The Authoritarian Personality</em> (1950), begun before the war, probed the question that taxed them all: why had the German people succumbed to Hitler’s seductions and engaged in a war that took barbarism to newly horrific dimensions?</p> <p>Given the philosophical difficulty of their project, it might seem surprising that critical theory – the name given to the Frankfurt school’s intellectual practice – is alive and well and reaches parts other branches of university enterprise often fail to reach. John Berger’s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/ways-of-seeing.html\" title=\"\"><em>Ways of Seeing</em></a> introduced Walter Benjamin’s resonant analysis of art in an age of mechanical reproduction to millions. In his latest book, <em>White Sands</em>, Geoff Dyer makes a pilgrimage to Adorno’s modest LA home in Brentwood, where many of the aphorisms in <em>Minima Moralia</em> were penned. At the start of Jonathan Franzen’s bestselling <em>The Corrections</em>, the impecunious hero sells his collection of Frankfurt school books to a secondhand dealer.</p> <p>Stuart Jeffries finds the title of his lively group biography in the Hungarian Marxist critic György Lukács’s ironising description of the Frankfurt school. Having taken up residence in a sumptuous grand hotel, they can indulge their pessimism from a safe distance and analyse the woes of the world rather than engage in the struggle for change. Well before Adorno’s 1966 book of that name, the group was engaged in negative dialectics. Jeffries is an able though combative narrator, drawing in large swaths of material but demanding that his biographees justify their projects and behaviour at every point. He’s worried about their class credentials. He doesn’t quite trust intellectuals for whom thinking seems work enough. Fine journalist that he is, he wants to interrogate the fact that the Frankfurt headquarters was built with capitalist money, that research was done for governments. He also wants to question their lack of active political engagement early on and in the radical 1960s and 70s when the call from students came.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For Benjamin at the last, hope wasn’t there: he committed suicide at the Spanish border while fleeing the Nazis</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Herbert Marcuse is the exception: his <em>Eros and Civilisation </em>and bestselling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/15/frankfurt-school-herbert-marcuse\" title=\"\"><em>One-Dimensional Man</em></a> influenced the 1968 generation of radicals, whether Marxist, liberationist, hippy or just young. Then Black Panther <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/dec/14/angela-davis-there-is-an-unbroken-line-of-police-violence-in-the-us-that-takes-us-all-the-way-back-to-the-days-of-slavery\" title=\"\">Angela Davis</a> was among them. Marcuse held out some hope, at least of art, and stepped into the fray, even writing on Marxism and feminism. During the anti-Vietnam war years, he took on the mantle of a cultural hero.</p> <p>Adorno, the greater philosopher, had meanwhile returned to Frankfurt. Though he supported some student action, he was also critical of what he called “left fascism”. In January 1969, he called in police to dislodge an “occupation”. As legend has it, his death was hastened by a rowdy “Busenaktion” in which three women bared their breasts during a lecture. He died of a heart attack on 6 August that year.</p> <p>Jeffries has set himself a daunting task in trying to combine life stories, a rapidly changing context of time and place, as well as explication of difficult philosophical work, some of which he doesn’t seem always to relish. Direct contact provides a fascinating interview with Jürgen Habermas, a rebel against the older Frankurtians as they were against their own fathers. He finds Habermas’s optimism a little Pollyanna-ish, but something of a relief. His ideas about democracy and the public sphere are compelling as is his system for working out ways in which “the citizens of a political community could still exercise collective influence over their social destiny through the democratic process”.</p> <p>Jeffries’s favourite among his cast is palpably the great Walter Benjamin, the Kafka of critical theory. The last words of Marcuse’s <em>One-Dimensional Man</em> come from Benjamin. “It is only for the sake of those without hope that hope is given to us.” For Benjamin at the last, hope wasn’t there: he committed suicide at the Spanish border while fleeing the Nazis.</p> <p>Little wonder, given the history of the 20th century, that the Frankfurt school gave us intellectual pessimism and negative dialectics. Jeffries’s biography is proof that such a legacy can be invigorating.</p> <p><em>Lisa Appignanesi’s </em><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/trials-of-passion-368228.html\" title=\"\"><em>Trials of Passion</em></a><em> (Virago) is out now in paperback.

So unexpectedly dramatic! Loved at conception, despised by some, complex, overstretched, noticeable, public, and at the same time deeply, deeply underground. Although the name first appeared in a study published in 1974, Crossrail was given royal assent in 2008, and the real action began when work commenced in May 2009. If you’re a Londoner, you’ve seen the hoardings, you’ve heard the clanking, and now: time for the book. Gillian Tindall’s attempt to find drama in the great infrastructure project of our time cannot rely on splintering disasters, like the collapse on the Metropolitan works in June 1862. But neither is this simply a story of tunnelling in the dirt. Tindall is interested in excavation into both the layered soil of the city and London’s past.</p> <p>Crossrail has already changed the face of London. That fun little wart called the Astoria was excised in 2009 – “the first indication that Crossrail was for real”, according to one professor of planning. While she gazes at the muddy pit of Crossrail work at Tottenham Court Road, Tindall spies workers moving cautiously, like “well-drilled demons in suits the colour of fire”, as they tear away layers to reveal, once again, just how much of the city is built on what Tindall calls the “vestigial human matter” that can be found throughout. (Enjoy your dinner at Morito tonight; you too, my fellow Londoner, will be vestigial human matter some day.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The book is at its best when Tindall is concerned with the city’s guts, the findings, the workings</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It’s all exciting and mysterious, but don’t expect a romp. Tindall has read the headlines that accompany construction discoveries. The <em>Evening Standard</em> told readers in May 2009 that “remains linked to workhouse are tested for anthrax and plague”. So she’s ready, like a Mary Whitehouse of public works, to censor anything that resembles “history porn”. It’s not like that. London’s history is not out to kill us. Tindall is keen to tramp down fears that we might be struck dead by the remnants of plague pits, “as if the untamed and noxious spirits of the long past might come back to wreak vengeance on the careless, living, privileged people of today”. If anything, recent discoveries have proven Londoners’ fondness for order. In 2013, Crossrail archaeologists found plague bodies that weren’t chucked in a pit but rather “laid down individually, in neat rows, aligned south-west to north-east”.</p> <p>Londoners don’t change. Tindall delineates the line that connects the self-serving behaviour of Londoners in any era. During Crossrail construction, property owners 30 metres atop underground tunnels were assured their homes wouldn’t suffer subsidence. “The same assurances had had to be given out 100 years before when the first deep tubes were built.” Disapproval of urban growth resurfaces in every era – the ineradicable Nimby gene. Delay has always been a part of London life, although now we can wait on platforms without ingesting the “black fumes that poisoned the palate with sulphur” as George Gissing did in the 1890s.</p> <p>Tindall structures her book so that the Crossrail journey winds east, from Farringdon to Liverpool St to Whitechapel and beyond, and at each stop she jumps around chronologically to tell potted histories and elaborate on what social and architectural history lies in the Crossrail path, from Bedlam to <em>Bleak House</em>. But is this the best way to present popular history? Sometimes Tindall discovers a poetic way to present her time-travelling leaps. In St Giles, for instance, she invites us to imagine as “the film rewinds rapidly backwards: crowded, soot-imbued tenements shake themselves out into old, timbered buildings with vegetable plantations and orchards between, or diminish into thatch-roofed cottages”. It’s a beautiful image. But often the constant chronological to and fro is dizzying as she leaps centuries ahead and back.</p> <p>The book is at its best when Tindall is concerned with the city’s guts, the findings, the workings, when she lets herself witness this great transformation of our own time. Transport aficionados will appreciate her attention to detail while general readers will be heartened to be introduced to this mysterious world. Stick around to the end for the cameo of four hardworking yet modest characters who appear in the book’s final pages. Phyllis, Ada, Victoria and Elizabeth are the real stars – the 1,000-tonne tunnel-boring machines that have offered to us, selflessly, “four and a half million tonnes of deep-down London soil”.</p> <p><em>Craig Taylor’s book </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/londoners.html\" title=\"\"><em>Londoners</em></a><em> is published by Granta.

I keep looking around my office, just stopping for a second and thinking: “How did this happen?”</p> <p>Not once, no one single time, did it cross my mind that all this was going to happen. Let me explain why. I was thick at school – properly thick. I was so thick that in the first year of primary school they stuck me in with what teachers used to refer to as the “remedial class” or what the kids called the “divvies”. I was a divvy.</p> <p>I didn’t speak till I was four, and no matter how hard my mum and dad tried, I couldn’t write either. Something just wasn’t working in my head. I was a happy child; I know this because I have vivid memories of being in my cot and laughing like a drain as my brother and sister gave me a toy train for Christmas.</p> <p>When I got to school (after clinging on to the door knocker every morning and screaming the street down), I’d sit on my own in the corner and ignore the teacher and the other kids, hoping they’d all just go away. At some point in that first year of primary school I learned how to write my name, and that enabled me to bump up a few classes in my second year. The next seven years or so were utterly wasted on me. I hated school. I had friends, good friends who are still friends now, but I knew the education system was utterly wasted on me; it didn’t seem to fit me, so I laboured with it, as if it was a hand-me-down blazer. People hoped I’d grow into it, but I never did. I couldn’t wait to leave. I counted off the years, the months, the days, the hours and then the minutes, and then I left.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ef97990ad348401998c1aab1520a4f3a9901f9f1\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/30/1422640417336/68545804-4c72-4272-a254-6b490d6b94bc-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Schumacher\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Schumacher</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And then I went back. Sixth form, because my mum and dad literally pleaded with me. Then I left again, after four days, once and for all. I’d had enough. I had two O levels. And one of them was a glorified CSE (geography, if you must know). I think my most stunning failure was that I managed to get a U in my English O level.</p> <p>A “U”. I was devastated. I cried on my way home, because I thought the one thing I wanted to do, the one dream I’d always had, the one glimmer of hope I could hold on to, had been taken away from me. I wanted to be a writer but I’d blown it.</p> <p>A “U”. So I didn’t become a writer, I became a roofer. I consoled myself: at least they both began with an “r”. Roofing didn’t suit me, so I became a jeweller, then a warehouse worker, then a salesman, then… Well, the list goes on up until I was 40 and married, and a policeman. And then one day, I wasn’t.</p> <p>I was sleeping in my car, with just a dog for company, wondering what happened. I ended up driving a taxi. Giving lifts to the lovers, the lonely and the lager louts in late-night Liverpool. I’d fallen apart but working those long nights started putting me back together. In my mirror I saw thousands of different pairs of eyes staring back at me. And then one night, I realised that each of those pairs, every single one of them, had a story to tell.</p> <p>All I had to do was ask. So I did. One night there was drunken vicar who said: “I don’t think I’ve ever believed in God, and the hours are a killer…” Another night it was the two pot dealers: “There’s no money in weed since everyone started dealing, and carrying the new stuff makes your tracksuit stink.”</p> <p>“Me ma has to boil mine.”</p> <p>“Makes them shrink, lad; costs us a fortune.”</p> <p>There were the sad stories, like the lady who caught a taxi to the cashpoint at five to midnight on New Year’s Eve. Just so she wouldn’t be alone when the world linked arms and started singing “Auld Lang Syne”. We sat and watched some fireworks together, and I remember how surprised I was that her hands were so warm when she wished me “Happy New Year, son” before she went off to have a miserable one of her own.</p> <p>There was the old man who asked me to wait while he visited his wife: “I’ll only be five minutes, I just want to check she is OK.” We were in the cemetery.</p> <p>In the small hours there was a lot of time to think about the people I met. All these stories, all these people living unnoticed lives. A thousand tales sliding across my back seat, never to be told. So I started filling notebooks, pen portraits with poor grammar of the people who passed me by. It wasn’t long before I had more notebooks than I’d had when I was a copper.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"436f5535ab347c3189a7e8133d33dff871f843e8\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/28/1422456719260/46ffca13-dea8-47d6-bad2-4a443ee7a26d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"'In my cab’s mirror I saw thousands of pairs of eyes.

I’ll have a read.”</p> <p>I went home and wrote a story, and it changed my life. I wrote about the young girl who was being beaten by her boyfriend. I wrote about the mother and daughter taking payday loans to reach the next payday, and then taking a payday loan to… Well, you get the picture. I wrote them all; I told their stories.</p> <p>And then I started to write a book.

Here are works that could be read from start to finish in that time","byline":"Ben Myers","body":"<p>How exactly a one-sitting novella is defined depends upon an individual’s reading speed. Broad definitions have the novella as a work of anything between 15,000 and 40,000 words. In fact, many of the most widely read (and taught) literary works qualify as one-sitting reads. A Christmas Carol, Call Of The Wild, Heart Of Darkness, The Great Gatsby, Of Mice and Men, Animal Farm, A Clockwork Orange – all could be technically considered novellas. Other key works – Melville’s Bartleby, the Scrivener, for example – are deemed short stories.</p> <p><strong>Notes From Underground by Fyodor Dostoevsky (1864)</strong></p> <p>A work of two distinct halves, Dostoevsky’s novella concerns human suffering, as expressed first through the diaries of an alienated narrator and then via a series of his jarring encounters. Pain and poverty also play a part in what is often considered the birth of existentialist fiction. It ends with the memorable line “it seems that we may stop here.”</p> <p><strong>Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka (1915)</strong></p> <p>All the tropes of Kafka’s work are explored when salesman Gregor Samsa awakes to find he has turned into an <em>ungeheures Ungeziefer</em> – a “monstrous vermin”, beetle or bug. And so begin his satirical and moving attempts to survive the burdens of an absurd situation in an increasingly absurd world.</p> <p><strong>Giovanni’s Room by James Baldwin (1956)</strong></p> <p>Adrift in Paris while his girlfriend returns to America to consider his marriage proposal, David falls in love with the charismatic bartender Giovanni. Sexuality, love, manhood, monogamy and betrayal are swiftly brought into question. The themes reflect Baldwin’s own exile in Paris – though his publisher first suggested he burn the manuscript of this tender and economical work.</p> <p><strong>The Driver’s Seat by Muriel Spark (1970)</strong></p> <p>Fleeing her dull job in a Northern European country, Lise heads south on holiday where she reinvents herself as temptress on a quest for sex and adventure. But when a history of erratic behaviour and a death become apparent, Spark reveals The Driver’s Seat to be what she called a “whydunnit”.</p> <p><strong>A Month In The Country by JL Carr (1980)</strong></p> <p>Tom Birkin’s employment restoring a Medieval mural in a Yorkshire village during the summer of 1920 initially suggests a pastoral and wistful work. Yet like local archaeologist Moon, he is a survivor of the recent battle of Passchendaele in the first world war, and the shadow of conflict looms large over this melancholic and utterly moving work.</p> <p><strong>Fup by Jim Dodge (1983)</strong></p> <p>Belligerent 99-year-old whisky-swilling Jake Santee and his adopted gentle giant of a son Tiny are joined by mallard duck Fup, whose rambunctious personality is matched only by his expanding appetite. With shades of Mark Twain and A Confederacy Of Dunces, Dodge delivered a debut novella that looks set to stay the distance.</p> <p><strong>Sukkwan Island by David Vann (2008)</strong></p> <p>The central piece in Vann’s Legend Of A Suicide collection sees young Roy accompany his failed and suicidal father on an ill-advised sojourn into the Alaskan wilderness. Hanging on an unexpected plot development, it’s a gruelling, oppressive, gripping and disturbing piece of writing whose power and intensity are heightened when read unbroken.</p> <p><strong>Train Dreams by Denis Johnson (2012)</strong></p> <p>A humble labourer in the American West during the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, Robert Grainier’s life and losses – of innocence, of family – can be read as both an allegorical history of contemporary America or simply the struggle of one man trying to make sense of human existence. Either way, Train Dreams confirmed Denis Johnson as one of the greatest living writers.</p> <p><strong>The Fifty Year Sword by Mark Z Danielewski (2012)</strong></p> <p>Less a piece of prose and more a tapestry of words – or a detonated poem perhaps – this takes the traditional fireside ghost story and inverts it. At a birthday party in East Texas five orphans are entertained by the tale of a sword with a blade that’s capable of inflicting wounds only visible when the victim turns 50.</p> <p><strong>The Dig by Cynan Jones (2014)</strong></p> <p>A dark, unnerving and compact work about a sadistic badger-baiter and a bereaved farmer set in rural Wales, The Dig epitomises the power and economy of the novella at its masterful best. Jones’s stripped-down language echoes the repressed emotions of men in turmoil against a backdrop of darkening copses and sodden fields.</p>","wordcount":"715","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-26T16:08:47Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"US","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/455m8"},"tags":[{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"books/jamesbaldwin","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"James Baldwin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jamesbaldwin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/jamesbaldwin","references":[]},{"id":"books/franzkafka","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Franz Kafka","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/franzkafka","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/franzkafka","references":[]},{"id":"books/fyodordostoevsky","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Fyodor Dostoevsky","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/fyodordostoevsky","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/fyodordostoevsky","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"tone/blog","type":"tone","webTitle":"Blogposts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/blog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/blog","references":[]},{"id":"profile/benmyers","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Ben Myers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/benmyers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/benmyers","references":[],"bio":"<p>Ben Myers is an author and journalist.

So why wasn’t anyone listening to a quadriplegic boy and a mother who simply wanted the truth to be heard?","byline":"Michelle Dean","body":"<p>When he wrote a blogpost in 2012, complaining about the explosively popular genre of books about near-death experiences, the evangelical writer and editor Phil Johnson did not know what he was getting into. He was voicing a concern common in the evangelical community about what he called the <a href=\"http://www.gty.org/Blog/B121018/the-burpomalarkey-doctrine\">“Burpo-Malarkey doctrine”</a>. Johnson believed that Colton Burpo, whose story was told in the hugely popular Heaven is for Real, and Alex Malarkey, who had co-written The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven, drew false pictures of heaven in their books.</p> <p>“No true evangelical ought to be tempted to give such tales any credence whatsoever, no matter how popular they become,” Johnson wrote.</p> <p>In Bellefontaine, Ohio, Alex Malarkey’s mother, Beth, was reading. Beth and Alex had left a trail telling the truth all over the internet, even as The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven kept selling. But nobody else was listening to her or her son any more, so she called Johnson almost immediately.</p> <p>“You’re right, this whole story is fabricated,” Johnson recalled Beth Malarkey telling him. “[But] because the book was a bestseller, no one in the evangelical publishing industry wanted to kill it.”</p> <p>Johnson would spend the next two years trying to help Beth get out that message – that Alex’s story wasn’t real, that a child who had almost died in a car accident in 2004 had been pushed to expand upon a fairytale he’d told when he was six.</p> <p>Following the accident, Alex spent two months in a coma and woke up paralysed. But his description of what happened in between offered a compelling tale of life after death, including visions of angels and meeting Jesus. The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven, published in 2010 with Alex and his father Kevin listed as co-authors, eventually became a bestseller – one billed as a description of “miracles, angels, and life beyond this world”.</p> <p>But last week, following persistent rumours, Alex, now 16, revealed that the detail in the book was false. “I said I went to heaven because I thought it would get me attention,” <a href=\"http://pulpitandpen.org/2015/01/13/the-boy-who-came-back-from-heaven-recants-story-rebukes-christian-retailers/\">he wrote on his own blog</a>.</p> <p>“I did not die. I did not go to heaven. When I made the claims, I had never read the Bible. People have profited from lies, and continue to. They should read the Bible, which is enough,” Alex wrote.</p> <p>Jokes playing on his surname have been made far and wide, but Alex Malarkey is not James Frey for the evangelical set. He was not, and still is not, an adult. He is dependent on the care of others. Contesting this book would mean discrediting his own father as his co-author. It would also pit Alex against an evangelical publishing industry that has made huge profits off too-good-to-be-true memoirs that demand readers take them, quite literally, on faith.</p> <p>At a time when publishing is under pressure from Amazon and e-books, near-death experience books are reliable, even phenomenon-level business: the story of Burpo – which includes visions of Jesus on a horse and his miscarried baby sister during an emergency appendectomy – has reportedly sold more than 10m books, and The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven moved over 1m copies before its publisher pulled the book from shelves on Friday.</p> <p>The publisher, <a href=\"http://www.tyndale.com/00_Home/index.php?ref=https://www.google.com/\">Tyndale House</a>, said in a statement it was “saddened to learn” that its co-author “is now saying that he made up the story of dying and going to heaven.” Since the scandal broke, the Malarkeys have not spoken publicly. According to family members, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2914010/Family-stands-father-wrote-book-son-said-saw-Jesus-following-car-wreck-boy-claims-attention.html\">Kevin Malarkey seems to be standing by the book</a>. The agent who sold Alex’s story to Tyndale House – who reassured them by telling them how the book money could help, his mother wrote on her blog – has also remained silent.</p> <p>But a closer look at family correspondence and social media postings in the years in between reveals how a push for sales can obscure the truth when it’s easier not to listen. Since at least 2011, Alex and Beth Malarkey have been telling people, on her blog, that the memoir had substantial inaccuracies. Emails obtained by the Guardian from Phil Johnson make clear they have been telling the publisher directly since at least 2012.</p> <p>When pressed to acknowledge the prior correspondence, Tyndale House admitted in a statement that: “For the past couple of years we have known that Beth Malarkey … was unhappy with the book, and believed it contained inaccuracies.”</p> <p>“It is because of this new information that we are taking the book out of print,” the publisher clarified in a follow-up statement on Tuesday. “At no time did the co-authors communicate to Tyndale that the core story of the book – Alex’s self-described supernatural experience – was untrue.”</p> <p>But Beth Malarkey’s complaints are all over the internet. You can find her comments cascading on the religious blogosphere, and on her Facebook wall. Usually she leaves them on pieces critical of The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven. She was adamant that the book misrepresented Alex’s involvement. And theirs is not the only near-death story that has raised skeptical eyebrows – even among evangelicals.</p> <p>“Alex Malarkey not only has to deal with a devastating injury, but now has to disentangle himself from this far-reaching deception,” John MacArthur, an evangelical pastor who has long criticized Christian publishers, wrote in an email. “All these supposed trips to heaven are hoaxes, and they prey on people in the most vulnerable way, because they treat death in a superficial, deceptive fashion.”</p> <h2>The making of a bestseller: the father, the money and the agent</h2> <p>A book deal wasn’t anyone’s first thought after a car accident left Alex paralyzed below the neck in November 2004. In fact, he spent the first two months after the accident in a coma. His parents were churchgoers, and the community rallied around them. In a <a href=\"http://www.examiner.org/news/5275-worlds-away-from-sheer-survival\">2009 article in their local paper</a>, Beth Malarkey said the family had the support of more than 40 local pastors while they kept a vigil at the hospital.</p> <p>“The consistent message we heard was: ‘Your son will be healed,’” she was quoted as saying. “We believed that hope was there; with God there is no impossibility.”</p> <p>That is the environment in which Alex woke up: high on emotion, high on faith-based messages. As described in the now-discredited book, his stories about heaven recite certain familiar elements of religious myth. For example, Alex said he saw angels that were “big and muscular”, with “wings on their backs from their waists to their shoulders”. He also said he saw the devil, beheld white tunnels of light, had an out-of-body experience, and spoke to Jesus.</p> <p>At first, his parents seem to have been dubious. They mentioned the stories in posts to a now-defunct site they’d set up to document Alex’s recovery. But no one, then, seems to have thought Alex’s stories were worthy of a book.</p> <p>For five years, the Malarkeys were not looking for a wider audience. “I felt no urge, really, to share the story,” Kevin Malarkey actually <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbUcAJ8VZFw\">told the Coast to Coast AM radio show in 2011</a>. “I think, for one, we were busy with our own lives. I mean, my wife – she doesn’t like when I say it – kind of became a full-time nurse at that point.”</p> <p>But then, in January 2009, Alex attracted media attention when he became the youngest person ever to have a “diaphragm pacing system” installed. Christopher Reeve, who played Superman, <a href=\"http://www.synapsebiomedical.com/news/03_03_13.shtml\">famously had one</a>, after his injury in a horse-riding accident. Alex’s was installed by the same surgeon.</p> <p><a href=\"http://amomonamission.blogspot.com/2013/09/alex-malarkeya-timeline-of-truth.html\">On her blog</a>, Beth Malarkey that her husband was seduced by the press there and then. Kevin has openly said that an Associated Press reporter covering the surgery told him to write the book. “I kid you not,” Kevin said in that 2011 radio interview. “My response was: ‘About what?’”</p> <p>Within four months, Kevin Malarkey had brought an agent named Matt Jacobson to the house to meet his son. Beth wrote <a href=\"http://amomonamission.blogspot.com/2013/09/alex-malarkeya-timeline-of-truth.html\">on her blog</a> that she was against the idea of any meeting, because she felt Alex was too ill. (The health of a quadriplegic can be very delicate, and Alex was in and out of the hospital with various ailments throughout 2010 and 2011.) Beth was overruled. And she also has bad memories of the encounter:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I remember the man talking to Alex and to me, but not by myself. He never really asked me what I thought, but instead told me what monies could possibly be made from not only doing a book, but a series of books and possibly a movie. He reassured me how much that money could help with Alex’s needs. What stuck out was money!</p> </blockquote> <p>Jacobson, the agent, did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this article. In the book’s acknowledgements, Kevin Malarkey writes: “Thank you, Matt Jacobson, for – what haven’t you done? – praying, writing, editing, and serving us as our agent and, most importantly, as our friend.”</p> <h2>‘From Alex’: a deal, a video shoot and a contract</h2> <p>Kevin Malarkey got his book deal by late 2009. The publisher would be Tyndale House, a major Christian publishing company with annual revenues of about $175m. Tyndale publishes a popular version of the Bible (the New Living Translation, with some 26m sold) and the Left Behind series (about 63m copies). And like every Christian publisher, Tyndale was aware of the public appetite for been-to-heaven-and-back stories. Popular accounts of near-death experiences have been commercial bestsellers since at least 1975, as Robert Gottlieb pointed out in a recent article for the <a href=\"http://www.gty.org/Blog/B121018/the-burpomalarkey-doctrine\">New York Review of Books</a>.</p> <p>But Beth Malarkey recounts on her blog that Tyndale House employees came to the Bellefontaine home for visits and interviewed Alex repeatedly as the book was prepared. Promotional spots were filmed inside the Malarkey home.</p> <p>At that time, Alex was still repeating the stories he had told about his spiritual experiences. But Beth writes that it was obvious to her that the focus of the Tyndale House employees’ questions made Alex uncomfortable. They kept asking about heaven and angels, and he was growing unhappy about having to talk about them.</p> <p>Even a Tyndale House executive seemed to acknowledge this, in an April 2012 email to Beth about the film crew obtained by the Guardian: “I wasn’t there, but was told by my colleagues that Alex didn’t want to be interviewed on video. I wasn’t aware that Alex didn’t want anything in the book about heaven and angels.”</p> <p>Beth adds that when consulted on the cover and title of the book, Alex was strongly against the ones that were eventually chosen. The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven was nonetheless published – with Alex’s name on the cover – in July 2010. Some parts of the book are presented so as to suggest that they are in Alex’s voice. They are titled “from Alex”. But all parties seem to agree that Alex did not write them, and he never signed a contract with Tyndale and on the copyright register. While Alex is listed as a co-author of the book, Kevin Malarkey is listed as the only claimant of the copyright. On the form, Alex’s father indicated he had acquired his sole copyright “by written agreement”.</p> <p>The copyright, as it turns out, was lucrative. The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven spent much of 2011 on the New York Times bestseller list. Kevin Malarkey built a speaking career on it, traveling and giving interviews – alone. He could not be reached for comment for this article.</p> <h2>‘Giving Alex a voice’: emails, inaccuracies and the meeting that never happened</h2> <p>The dam began to break in August 2011. Early that month, Alex logged on to Facebook and went on to the fan page for the book. (He can access the internet himself, with a computer he controls with his mouth.) There, he left a cryptic comment under his own name: “1 of the most deceptive books ever.”</p> <p>Fans began to reply angrily, questioning whether this could possibly be the real Alex. Whoever controlled the fan page deleted the comment.</p> <p>Beth Malarkey later posted a copy of the Facebook comment thread <a href=\"http://amomonamission.blogspot.com/2012/11/following-is-post-that-my-son-alex.html\">to her blog</a>. From there on out, she began to write – on evangelical blogs and in private emails to the publisher, obtained by the Guardian – about how her “child is being exploited and that is truth”.</p> <p>Tyndale House maintains that it only learned of Alex’s retraction recently. But as early as April 2012, Beth was in touch with the publisher, complaining of what she called the book’s inaccuracies. Her emails are long and complicated, quoting passages from the book and then explaining what is wrong with them.</p> <p>“I know it is not all that I know to be ‘off’ but it is at least some,” she writes in the first such email, dated 22 April 2012. Almost all of the inaccuracies, she say, relate back to a single theme: that this is not Alex’s story, but Kevin’s, and that it is inaccurate. (Kevin and Beth Malarkey are still legally married, but do not speak to each other, and have not for some time.)</p> <p>Jan Long Harris, a publisher with Tyndale House, was Beth Malarkey’s primary correspondent. She offered to correct inaccuracies in consultation with Kevin, “since our contract is with him”. According to the emails newly obtained by the Guardian, Harris acknowledged that Beth had presented larger issued with the book, writing: “I realize that your concern about what you feel are inaccuracies is not the only issue you have with the book, but it is the issue that could be most easily addressed.”</p> <p>Beth replied: “Revisions are not what will restore what has been stolen from my son, who continues to suffer.” She asked if Tyndale House could break its contract with Kevin Malarkey.</p> <p>Harris, evidently exasperated, replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Even if we could make a case for breaking our contract, the book could (and probably would) be back in print with another publisher within a few weeks. So I don’t think that would achieve your goal.</p> <p>Also, I’m sure you can understand that we can’t break a contract with an author just because someone else – even if the someone else is the author’s spouse – makes accusations about him. We have to give the author, in this case Kevin, a chance to respond.</p> <p>As far as giving Alex a voice, we would be glad to talk with Alex and hear what he has to say about the book. I offer again to come to your home to talk with you, Kevin and Alex, for the purpose of giving all three of you a voice. I know you are concerned that there might be repercussions after such a meeting, but would they be worse than the current situation? At the very least, I think a phone call with you and Kevin is essential.</p> </blockquote> <p>When the Guardian contacted Tyndale House for comment about the email correspondence, the publisher wrote back with a more detailed statement: “On more than one occasion we asked for a meeting with Kevin, Beth, Alex and their agent to discuss and correct any inaccuracies,” the publisher said, “but Beth would not agree to such a meeting.”</p> <p>In its Tuesday statement to the Guardian, Tyndale House clarified: </p> <p>“After originally agreeing to a meeting, Mrs Malarkey sent us an email on May 22 2012, saying that out of concern for her son she no longer wished to meet. When we learned of Alex’s recent public statement, we responded by taking the book out of print.”</p> <p>According to Phil Johnson, who keeps in regular touch with Beth and provided her emails with Tyndale House to the Guardian, the reason Beth did not agree to a meeting was that the situation seemed adversarial to her.</p> <p>“The thread that runs through all their correspondence with Beth is that they wanted to corner her before they would be willing to investigate her concerns,” he wrote to the Guardian. “They kept pressing her to agree to a meeting where she and Alex would have to face Kevin and a phalanx of editors who were determined to press ahead with the project, no matter what objections Alex and she might have.”</p> <p>Beth Malarkey simply kept complaining on the internet. Tyndale House kept publishing a book with a quadriplegic boy’s name on the cover, even though it knew he had substantial objections to the book. And for years, nothing changed. Until Alex posted that open letter.</p> <h2>‘I still remember’: the anger of the duped and the persistence of believers</h2> <p>On Friday, as the headlines and Malarkey puns were still flying, Johnson spoke to Beth Malarkey on the phone, gauging her mood. (She has declined <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/review/R7W7W0E9WJ7YS/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B00I5QX31Y&amp;nodeID=133140011&amp;store=digital-text\">all press interview requests</a>, citing childcare obligations.) Her feelings, he told the Guardian, are mixed.</p> <p>“She’s glad on one level that the truth is finally out there,” he said. “I also think she’s scared, a little bit cautious about what is yet to come. She doesn’t have any source of income. Her life is not easy.”</p> <p>There will be consequences for the Malarkeys. They cannot continue as they have. The evangelical publishers once so eager to pick up her son’s story are bound to stay away now. This disgusts people like MacArthur, the pastor and critic of the niche publishers, who commented: “The word exploitation is very appropriate. The children are exploited. The Christian public is exploited. The buyers are exploited.”</p> <p>And any other way for the Malarkeys to make money seems to be foreclosed. The second book Kevin Malarkey published with Matt Jacobson, entitled A Beautiful Defeat: Find True Freedom and Purpose in Total Surrender to God, did not sell quite as well. It lacked the emotional pull of the near-death hook. Already, it has garnered <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/review/R7W7W0E9WJ7YS/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B00I5QX31Y&amp;nodeID=133140011&amp;store=digital-text\">one angry anonymous Amazon review</a>: “So basically the same guy who lied about the accounts in his first book, The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven (notice he doesn’t even mention the title in the About the Author – strange, huh?) has written another one,” the reviewer writes. “He shouldn’t be allowed to author any more books unless it’s about telling the truth and apologizing to the public for the first dupe.”</p> <p>If such anger seems out of proportion, the anger of the duped often is. There is something profoundly enraging about having a story you truly believe, as many truly believe such near-death narratives, exposed as false. Colton Burpo, the subject of Heaven Is For Real, seems desperate himself to avoid the blowback.

Best of all the drama is legit. Even the sex scenes make sense. <br /></p> <p>They are the kinds of novels I like to call ‘literary small-chops’: short and accessible on mobiles or tablets which can go anywhere your purse goes. They are fun to read and can- word of warning -be very addictive. </p> <p>I’ve read half of the titles – which launched on December 15 – and can predict, with the knowledge of a literary blogger, that they are set to become an obsession in 2015. </p> <p>And you won’t break the bank trying to read them all, due to publisher-promotion, each story costs less than 500 Naria (£1.70). </p> <p>Here’s my synopsis of the new novels on offer:</p> <h2> Finding Love Again</h2> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/chioma.iwunze\">Chioma Iwunze-Ibiam</a>’s Finding Love Again, jilted bride and radio broadcaster, Kambi, flees to the poetic solitude of Obudu Ranch, where she hopes to finish writing her poetry collection. But love comes looking for her in the form of a secret from her past.</p> <h2>A Tailor-Made Romance</h2> <p>Oyindamola Affinih’s Lagos story titled A Tailor-Made Romance is an urban fairy tale where Tishe, the beautiful advertising executive meets Adnan, a tailor from the suburb of Mushin. </p> <h2>A Taste of Love</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sifushka\">Sifa Gowon</a>’s A Taste of Love is a love story that builds on the power of food. Let’s just say the love affair – between Adoo, a Jos-based cake maker and Toby, a successful club manager – happens somewhere between a delicious pizza and a suspicious cheese cake.</p> <h2>Black Sparkle Romance</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.ankarapress.com/blogs/news/18392855-interview-with-ankara-press-author-amara-nicole-okolo\">Amara Okolo</a>’s Black Sparkle Romance pits Mira, a magazine editor, and Dominic, a high-profile fashion photographer, in an elusive and beautiful tussle of love.</p> <h2>Love’s Persuasion</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.olaawonubi.com/\">Ola Awonubi</a>’s Love’s Persuasion is proof that accountants are not just about numbers and ledgers – they can also fall in love! The character Ada Okafor proves this only too well when she finds herself entangled in an office romance with a British-trained assistant manager who works at the Lagos firm of City Finance.</p> <h2>Elevator Kiss</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/brittlepaper/statuses/546265681302286336\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Cant sleep. In bed reading Elevator Kiss. What do I think of it? Marvelous! *in bridget jones&#39; voice.* <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeremyweate\">@jeremyweate</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/XKz2ReQAqT\">pic.twitter.com/XKz2ReQAqT</a></p>&mdash; Ainehi Edoro  (@brittlepaper) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brittlepaper/status/546265681302286336\">December 20, 2014</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>In <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/missaminathula\">Amina Thula</a>’s Cape Town romance Elevator Kiss, the leading couple break all the rules when, as perfect strangers, they kiss on their first encounter. This sets off a roller coaster, passionate love affair.</p> <h2>What are you reading?</h2> <p>If you live in Africa, or are a fan of African fiction we want to hear from you. What do you think of the launch of Ankarapress? Are you tempted to dip your nose in to one of their titles? What other romance novels have you enjoyed?

Castle","byline":"Maev Kennedy","body":"<p>The export of a unique manuscript, a 16th-century translation of a work by the great humanist scholar Erasmus, has been delayed by the government.</p> <p>The translation was almost certainly made by William Tyndale, who later translated the Bible into English and was burned at the stake for his beliefs in 1536.</p> <p>The significance of the volume, which has been in the library of Alnwick Castle, Northumberland, since at least the 19th century, was only realised when it was put up for sale last summer by the Duke of Northumberland. The export to an undisclosed overseas buyer will be delayed until April to give a UK institution a chance to match the auction price of almost £250,000 – five times the original estimate.</p> <p>The manuscript, believed by scholars to be made by Tyndale, is in the elegant writing of a professional scribe and was made in 1523, probably for presentation to Tyndale’s early patrons. It is the earliest translation into English of any Erasmus work. Later English versions of the Erasmus, Enchiridion militis Christiani (The Handbook of a Christian Knight) – a humanist guide to lay devotion which was an admired and influential work across Europe – were believed based on a Tyndale translation but the original was thought to be lost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fecdb1d1-952a-49a1-8fb9-4485818dfe9e\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421249035641/1bb74471-3fcd-47a0-a6b1-27aeb7fe6a94-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"manuscript of William Tyndale's translation of a work by Erasmus\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Part of a page from the manuscript of William Tyndale’s translation of a work by Erasmus - The Handbook of a Christian Knight (1523).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sotheby's</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1523 Tyndale, whose Bible translation later influenced the authorised King James version, had graduated from Oxford and was working as a tutor in an aristocratic household back in his native Gloucestershire. He was already championing the philosophy of Erasmus and other reformers, and getting into disputes over scripture.</p> <p>According to John Foxe’s Book of Martyrs, he translated the Erasmus essay to justify his beliefs to his employers. The manuscript is believed to be the presentation copy he had made of that translation, the only surviving contemporary manuscript of any literary work by Tyndale.</p> <p>The 145-page manuscript had been in Alnwick since at least 1872, disguised in a much later red Morocco leather binding, and its significance was only spotted when it was included in a large sale from the Duke of Northumberland’s ancestral collection at Sotheby’s last summer.</p> <p>Christopher Wright, a member of the committee that advises the government on the export of important works of art, said: “This newly discovered translation of one of Erasmus’s most popular works would be of great interest in its own right. The tantalising possibility that it is the hitherto lost translation by William Tyndale confers on it international importance.”</p> <p>Culture minister Ed Vaizey described it as a rare and important work and said he sincerely hoped the money could be raised to keep it in Britain.</p>","wordcount":"439","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-17T15:30:07Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/44pzh"},"tags":[{"id":"culture/heritage","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Heritage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/heritage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/heritage","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"books/religion","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Religion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/religion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/religion","references":[]},{"id":"books/philosophy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Philosophy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/philosophy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/philosophy","references":[]},{"id":"uk/uk","type":"keyword","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webTitle":"UK news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/uk","references":[]},{"id":"tone/news","type":"tone","webTitle":"News","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/news","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/maevkennedy","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Maev Kennedy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/maevkennedy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/maevkennedy","references":[],"bio":"<p>Maev Kennedy is a special writer for the Guardian</p>","bylineImageUrl":"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/12/3/1449142224016/Maev-Kennedy.jpg","bylineLargeImageUrl":"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/12/3/1449142245982/Maev-Kennedy-L.png","firstName":"","lastName":"kennedy","rcsId":"GNL004696","r2ContributorId":"16031"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"publication","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webTitle":"The Guardian","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/all","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/publication/theguardian","references":[],"description":"All the latest from the world's leading liberal voice."},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","type":"newspaper-book","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webTitle":"Main section","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection","references":[]},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/uknews","type":"newspaper-book-section","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webTitle":"UK news","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/mainsection/uknews","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/mainsection/uknews","references":[]}],"elements":[{"id":"3aa08e122325d5d1435e1f7d7c61aeebc02a7f65","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421248467851/Erasmus-1467-1536--009.jpg","typeData":{"altText":"Erasmus (1467-1536) ","caption":"The humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus (1467-1536).

Two men in white flannels, one a film-maker, are looking back to last year’s fiesta. It was then, we discover, that Geoffrey Firmin – the former British consul, ex-husband of Yvonne, a rampant alcoholic and also a ruined man – embarked on his <em>via crucis</em>, an agonised passage through a fateful day, that would end in Firmin’s killing.</p> <p>Lowry himself, a refugee from the Fitzrovia of his contemporary George Orwell and the young Dylan Thomas, described <em>Under the Volcano </em>as “a prophecy, a political warning, a cryptogram, a preposterous movie, and a writing on the wall”. At the back of his mind, he was inspired by Melville (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/13/100-best-novels-observer-moby-dick\" title=\"\">No 17 in this series</a>) and the capacious majesty of <em>Moby-Dick</em>. Lowry’s Captain Ahab, however, is fighting a more nebulous nemesis than a whale. In 12 chapters corresponding to the 12 hours of the consul’s last day on earth, Lowry takes Firmin on a colossal bender, fuelled by beer, wine, tequila and mescal (“strychnine” to our protagonist). He is drinking himself to death, like Lowry himself, though<em> Under the Volcano </em>is about much more than alcoholism. Halfway through, the consul decides that “It was already the longest day in his entire experience, a lifetime”. Formally, then, the novel’s narrative technique owes a huge debt to Joyce, Conrad, and Faulkner (Nos <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/04/100-best-novels-ulysses-james-joyce-robert-mccrum\" title=\"\">46</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/28/100-best-novels-heart-of-darkness-joseph-conrad\" title=\"\">32</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/06/100-best-novels-as-i-lay-dying-william-faulkner\" title=\"\">55</a> in this series). Lowry’s text also teems with allusions to classical and Jacobean tragedy, echoing the cadences of Christopher Marlowe and the Elizabethans.</p> <p>One of mescal’s side-effects is a highly lucid, almost brilliant, depression: this is a dominant mood throughout much of Lowry’s introverted, strangely compulsive narrative. Again and again, he insists that he is present in all his characters, an assertion of complex consciousness that is also a deranged kind of solipsism provoked by tropical drink and drugs. We are in the Mexico that attracted many interwar English literary travellers, notably Lawrence, Waugh and Greene, but it’s a Mexico that has become a hell on earth.</p> <p>The background to the consul’s Day of the Dead is the drumbeat of conflict, both public and private. Germany is re-arming. Yvonne, Fimin’s divorced wife, has come back to challenge his drinking. “Must you go on and on forever into this stupid darkness?” she asks. At the edge of darkness there is death.<em> Under the Volcano </em>began in Lowry’s mind when, arriving in Mexico, he saw a local Indian bleeding to death by the roadside, which is how Firmin will end, shot in a cheap bar before being tossed into a ravine with a dead dog. The last moments of the consul at the end of the “Day of the Dead” (chapter 12) become one of the greatest passages of English prose on the eve of the second world war.</p> <h2>A note on the text</h2> <p>No writer in this series had as much trouble as Malcolm Lowry, from inside and out, with his work-in-progress. For the struggling author, in the making of his masterpiece, over nearly a decade, almost nothing went right. At first, in 1936, living in Cuernavaca, Mexico, in the shadow of two volcanoes (Popocatépetl and Iztaccihuatl), galloping alcoholism and a failing marriage, Lowry wrote a short story (not finally published until the 1960s) entitled “Under the Volcano”, a sketch of the bigger canvas that was to follow, including a horse branded with the number seven.</p> <p>The first, raw draft of <em>Under the Volcano</em> followed soon after. He considered this to be the “Inferno” element of a trilogy, <em>The Voyage that Never Ends</em>, modelled on Dante’s <em>Divine Comedy</em>. Ultimately, fate determined that only the first part of this ambitious project would ever be completed to its author’s satisfaction. In 1940, Lowry commissioned a New York literary agent, Harold Matson, to find a publisher for this manuscript, which was roundly rejected, up and down Manhattan.</p> <p>Next, between 1940 and 1944, Lowry revised the novel, with crucial editorial assistance from the actress Margerie Bonner, who saved him from the worst of his alcoholism and later became his second wife. This process absorbed him completely: during those years Lowry, who had previously preferred to address himself to several projects at the same time, worked on nothing but his manuscript. In 1944, the current draft was nearly lost in a fire at Lowry’s beach house (a squatter’s shack) in British Columbia. Bonner rescued the unfinished novel, but the rest of Lowry’s works in progress were consumed in the blaze.</p> <p>The novel was finished in 1945 and immediately submitted to a number of publishers. In late winter, while still travelling abroad, Lowry heard that his novel had been accepted by Reynal &amp; Hitchcock in the United States and Jonathan Cape in Britain. Cape had reservations about publishing and asked for drastic revisions. He added that if Lowry didn’t make the changes “it does not necessarily mean I would say no”. Lowry’s reply, written in January 1946, was a prolonged, vehement, slightly mad defence of the book as something to be considered a work of lasting greatness: “It can be regarded as a kind of symphony,” he wrote, “or in another way as a kind of opera – or even a horse opera. It is hot music, a poem, a song, a tragedy, a comedy, a farce and so forth … Whether it sells or not seems to me either way a risk. But there is something about the destiny of the creation of the book that seems to tell me it just might go on selling a very long time.”</p> <p>Cape published the novel without further revision. To Anthony Burgess it was “a Faustian masterpiece”. Yet, <em>Under the Volcano</em> was remaindered in England, and out of print when Lowry died of alcoholism in 1957. Thanks to a better response in North America, especially Canada, its afterlife has been lusty and international, featuring regularly on several “best novels” lists. Now it’s recognised as a classic.</p> <h2>Three More From Malcolm Lowry</h2> <p><em>Ultramarine</em> (1933); <em>Lunar Caustic </em>(1968);<em> October Ferry to Gabriola </em>(1970).</p>","wordcount":"1024","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-23T00:29:00Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/44ev3"},"tags":[{"id":"books/series/the-100-best-novels","type":"series","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"The 100 best novels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/series/the-100-best-novels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/series/the-100-best-novels","references":[],"description":"Robert McCrum selects the definitive 100 novels written in English"},{"id":"books/malcolm-lowry","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Malcolm Lowry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/malcolm-lowry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/malcolm-lowry","references":[]},{"id":"books/fiction","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Fiction","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/fiction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/fiction","references":[]},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/robertmccrum","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Robert McCrum","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/robertmccrum","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/robertmccrum","references":[],"bio":"<p>Robert McCrum is an associate editor of the <a href=\"http://observer.guardian.co.uk/\">Observer</a>.

Murder, intrigue and a beguiling protagonist make <strong>Adam LeBor</strong>’s international thriller <a href=\"http://www.harpercollins.com/9780062330017/the-washington-stratagem\"><strong>The Washington Stratagem</strong></a> a gripping and enticing read.<br /></p> <p><em><strong>Ed Pilkington, chief reporter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Edpilkington\">@Edpilkington</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>I’m both addicted to and critical of mystery novels. You start with high hopes: compelling clues, a little character development, a rollercoaster of unexpected discoveries, but you often walk away disappointed. </p> <p>But <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/dec/22/featuresreviews.guardianreview24\">Lisa Lutz’s The Spellman Files</a></strong> series turns the mystery novel on its head, and delivers an unexpectedly troubled and compulsive female protagonist in Izzy Spellman. It’s a fun escape with a relatable character. </p> <p><em><strong>Jessica Glenza, breaking news reporter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JessicaGlenza\">@JessicaGlenza</a>)</strong></em></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/books/review/james-risens-pay-any-price.html?_r=0\"><strong>Pay Any Price </strong><strong>b</strong><strong>y</strong><strong> James Risen</strong></a> and <a href=\"http://shaneharris.com/atwar/\"><strong>@War</strong><strong> by</strong> <strong>Shane Harris</strong></a> are both excellent pieces of national-security journalism. The former is a deeply reported and morally outraged dive into the bureaucratic grind of the national-security state after 9/11. The latter, also deeply reported, is a harbinger of where the US national-security state is headed next: ambling deeper into cyberspace, which it barely understands, in search of digital monsters to destroy. </p> <p><em><strong>Spencer Ackerman, national security editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/attackerman\">@attackerman</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>If watching the film without reading the book makes you look dumb, how stupid do you need to be to have watched two films without having read the book? <a href=\"http://www.pajiba.com/book_reviews/let-the-right-one-in-book-review.php\"><strong>John Ajvide Lindqvist’s </strong><strong>novel</strong><strong> Let the Right One In </strong></a>spawned two movies: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/apr/10/let-the-right-one-in-vampires-film-review\">the Swedish original</a> (great) and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/nov/04/let-me-in-film-review\">an American remake</a> (not nearly as bad as people say). I watched both, and when I came across the book in a secondhand shop I thought I should complete the trilogy. It was a great decision. Lindqvist manages to be both funny and scary while coming up with the slightest excuse to quote Morrissey. And if there’s one thing vampire novels need more of, it’s Morrissey.<br /></p> <p><em><strong>Tom Lutz, sports editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/tom_lutz\">@tom_lutz</a>)</strong></em></p> <p><strong>Lawrence in Arabia, </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/14/lawrence-arabia-modern-middle-east-review\"><strong>Scott Anderson</strong>’s biography of TE Lawrence</a>, was a cracker, and essential to understanding the rise of the Islamic State this year.</p> <p><em><strong>Dan Roberts, Washington bureau chief (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobertsDan\">@RobertsDan</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>My favorite book this year has been <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/18/create-perfect-wife-wendy-moore-review\">Wendy Moore’s How to Create the Perfect Wife</a></strong>, which thankfully is not an actual DIY guide. Instead, it’s a lively, novelistic look at a somewhat misogynistic member of the Victorian A-list of intellectuals who had such a terrible way with women that he spirited away two orphans, with the intent of training them to make his perfect wife. With cameos by a frowning Erasmus Darwin, George Sand and Henry James, it’s a little education in history as well as a beautifully written profile of a social experiment gone bad. </p> <p><em><strong>Heidi Moore, US finance and economics editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/moorehn\">@moorehn</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>Twenty-fourteen has indisputably been the year of <strong>Roxane Gay</strong>, and while the conversation has been dominated by the August release of Bad Feminist, her novel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/09/roxane-gay-bad-feminist-interview\"><strong>An Untamed State</strong></a> kicked off her reign. From the first sentence, Gay presents the reader with the one of the most visceral and haunting depictions of trauma on the female body and spirit.</p> <p><em><strong>Sarah Galo, open intern (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/SarahEvonne\">@SarahEvonne</a>)</strong></em></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/05/shining-girls-lauren-beukes-review\"><strong>Lauren Beukes’s The Shining Girls</strong></a> taught me how to love the suspense novel with its precise and powerful tale of a time-traveling serial killer and the rough, young female out to stop him. Beukes deserves perpetual praise for showing how to tell a complex crime story without glorifying the killer. </p> <p><em><strong>Amanda Holpuch, reporter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/holpuch\">@holpuch</a>)</strong></em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.basicbooks.com/full-details?isbn=9780465069996\">The Lonely War</a> by Nazila Fathi </strong>is a vivid and compelling memoir by the former New York Times correspondent in Tehran, who was forced into exile when government forces made threats to her life in the wake of her reporting on the Green Movement protests in 2009. Fathi recounts in exquisite detail three decades in pre and post-1979 Iran – revealing the inherent contradictions at the heart of life after the revolution. </p> <p><em><strong>Raya Jalabi, copy editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/rayajalabi\">@rayajalabi</a>)</strong></em></p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://davidsreynolds.com/?page_id=170\">Walt Whitman’s America: a Cultural Biography by David S Reynolds</a></strong> is all-enveloping on the man, his art, his century and his country. Accessible without conceding authority, hugely detailed without surrendering clarity or literary flair. A tremendous work of history.</p> <p>Honorable mention: <strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/One-Lucky-Bastard-Tales-Tinseltown/dp/1493007971\">One Lucky Bastard: Tales from Tinseltown by Sir Roger Moore</a></strong>.</p> <p><em><strong>Martin Pengelly, weekend editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MartinPengelly\">@MartinPengelly</a>)</strong></em></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/29/books/review/alice-goffmans-on-the-run.html?_r=0\"><strong>On the Run by Alice Goffman</strong></a> is an unbelievably good ethnography about urban poor and their relationship with criminal justice in Philly that has become pertinent in light of Eric Garner/Michael Brown. </p> <p><em><strong>Paul Lewis, Washington correspondent (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulLewis\">@PaulLewis</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>I was living in Australia for the first six months of the year and felt duty-bound to read <strong>Christos Tsiolkas</strong>’s latest book <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/03/barracuda-christos-tsiolkas-review\">Barracuda</a></strong>. I opened it expecting to hate-read it but immediately got pulled in. Angry, clever and compelling, it tells the story of Danny, the son of working class Greek immigrants whose talent as a swimmer puts him in a posh public school, with results as painful and inexorable as a belly flop from a diving board.</p> <p><em><strong>Alex Needham, arts editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexneedham74\">@alexneedham74</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>I started reading <strong>Michael Azzerad</strong>’s <strong><a href=\"http://\">Our Band Could Be Your Life</a> </strong>in January, while listening to a load of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2008/oct/01/1\">Alistair Cooke’s Letter From America</a> that covered the same period. It was a great combination of amazing lucid storytelling from the world of underground rock and fairly straight-laced tales of Reagan’s presidency. The two somehow dovetailed together quite neatly especially when the Minutemen sang about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/aug/20/usa.duncancampbell\">Iran-Contra</a> or Minor Threat reminisced about surviving on Reagan’s “government cheese”.</p> <p><em><strong>Lanre Bakare, commissioning editor (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/lanre_bakare\">@Lanre_Bakare</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>The best book I’ve read this year so far – and by far – was<strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/26/one-summer-1927-bill-bryson-review\"> One Summer: America, 1927 by Bill Bryson</a></strong>. Come for the exhaustive research of this historical snapshot of a year in the life of America; stay for Bryson’s effortless wit and charm and his exquisite eye for fascinating detail.</p> <p><em><strong>Nicky Woolf, reporter (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/NickyWoolf\">@NickyWoolf</a>)</strong></em></p> <p>Last year, around this time, I started reading a book about the internet – The Circle by Dave Eggers – on an iPad, which I lost on a plane, and then I tried to read it on my iPhone, and then Christmas was over, and so was my reading of the only book I read last year. This October, on vacation in Hawaii, I started reading a book about the beach – Inherent Vice, by Thomas Pynchon – on a beach, before<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/inherent-vice\"> the movie</a> came out, and then my vacation was over and now the movie is out and here I am reading something else on my iPhone and there is that book over there, dog-eared to page 183 and dust-gathering forevermore. The best book I read this year was the only book I read this year, and I didn’t even finish it. The best thing we all read in 2014 was <strong>the internet</strong>.</p> <p><em><strong>Matt Sullivan, comment editor (<a

again","trailText":"Publishers wary of signing well-known names for big money as sales stutter and Guinness World Records big seller again","byline":"Alison Flood and Caroline Davies \r\n","body":"<p>It used to be that for a guaranteed boost to sales, all publishers needed to do was sign up a celebrity, get a book out of them – by their own hand or not – put it in the shops and watch the cash roll in.</p> <p>But new figures show that perhaps Britain is falling out of love with the celebrity memoir, with few of the genre making the top 10 chart despite new offerings from the comedy stalwarts Stephen Fry, John Cleese, Graham Norton and Paul Merton.</p> <p>Only the memoir of Lynda Bellingham, the “Oxo mum” and Loose Woman who died of cancer in October this year, has made it into the top five. Her book, Something I’ve Been Dying to Tell You, sold 37,118 copies, according to sales monitors Nielsen Book, making it to No 4 in the chart.</p> <p>The memoir of the British motorcycle racer Guy Martin – a hero of the Isle of Man TT races who has carved a television career often based on his engineering skills – is the only other celebrity title to make the top 10, selling 31,931 and securing ninth place.</p> <p>A report in the Bookseller magazine said sales of biographies and autobiographies had fallen by almost 4% this year. Earlier this month Charlie Redmayne, UK chief executive of HarperCollins, revealed he had cut back on buying up stars as non-fiction celebrity titles proved risky when publishers had to pay a big advance on a title that could turn out to be unprofitable with a short shelf life. “We’re moving away from big celebrity hit-and-miss stuff,” he said.</p> <p>“I felt the company had embraced some quite risky celebrity non-fiction. A lot of these books were hugely expensive and they were not necessarily going to backlist [continue to sell] well.”</p> <p>The other Christmas staple buy – the cookbook – has also fared less well this year. Although Jamie Oliver has topped the Christmas charts multiple times with previous offerings, this year’s outing, Jamie’s Comfort Food, proved less appetising to readers, with a Christmas week sale of 33,309 copies putting it in seventh place in the chart. Tom Kerridge’s Best Ever Dishes was 10th.</p> <p>Jonathan Ruppin at independent book chain Foyles said: “I think inevitably we can’t keep selling celebrity autobiographies and cookbooks, and big-name fiction, as the things we push every year. Eventually people are bored of it and look for something else. This has been a terrific year for books across the board.”</p> <p>This year’s bestseller is the Guinness World Records account of everything from how far a dog can ride a scooter to the world’s tallest man – still Robert Wadlow, who was measured at 272cm (8ft 11.1ins) in 1940 – with sales of 58,477 copies in the week to 20 December. It is the first time it has headed the Christmas charts since 2002.</p> <p>In second place – with a gap of more than 15,000 copies – came David Walliams’s Awful Auntie, with sales of 42,695. “Do you have an awful auntie?” Walliams opens his hit children’s story. “Perhaps your aunt demands you wear that horrendously itchy jumper she knitted for you at Christmas? The one which reads ‘I Love My Auntie’ in huge purple letters on the front? However awful your auntie might be, she will never be in the same league of awfulness as Aunt Alberta.”</p> <p>Jeff Kinney’s latest Wimpy Kid offering, The Long Haul, in which “middle-school weakling” Greg Heffley and his family take a road trip, came in a narrow third, with sales of 42,279 copies.</p> <p>“I think it has been a very strong year for young adult and kids’ fiction. And it’s a good signal that books remain an excellent Christmas gift,” said Nielsen’s Andre Breedt. “That’s the story of Guinness – it shows books are still an exciting Christmas present.”</p> <p>Zoe Sugg’s debut novel, Girl Online, takes the fifth-place slot. Sugg, who has more than five million subscribers on YouTube for her fashion and beauty video blogs, ran into some controversy earlier this month when it emerged that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/11/zoella-ghostwriter-sioban-curham-controversy-childrens-author\" title=\"\">her novel had been ghostwritten</a>, but the drama does not appear to have affected sales, with Girl Online – about a teenage blogger – selling 34,787 copies.</p> <p>Outside the top five, the top 10 is rounded out by Gillian Flynn’s thriller smash Gone Girl and Boris Johnson’s biography of Churchill.</p> <p>“The big surprise this Christmas has been Guy Martin. This is the bestselling autobiography of the year and has been the bestselling non-fiction title for Waterstones so far in December – an astonishing achievement for a title that is eight months old and from a figure who is not as widely known as some of the celebrities with books out this autumn,” said Richard Humphreys, Waterstones’ non-fiction buyer.</p> <p>Foyles’ top 10 ranged from astronaut Chris Hadfield’s You Are Here to Japanese novel The Guest Cat by Takashi Hiraide, with just one memoir, neurosurgeon Henry Marsh’s Do No Harm, in the lineup.</p> <p>At Waterstones, the Private Eye Annual was the chain’s Christmas No 1, followed by Martin’s autobiography, Jessie Burton’s debut novel, The Miniaturist, and Girl Online.</p> <h2><strong>Nielsen book chart for Christmas week

When she went blind, she talked to me about it with extraordinary humour (how she chatted to the coat hanging on the back of the door, mistaking it for her husband, Colin, threw gloves onto the compost heap instead of potato peelings, made a fine debut with her white stick) and yet managed to convey her loss and horror. Life had always bashed her about and she had always refused to be defeated by it. She was one of the most generous-hearted women I’d ever encountered, living life full-throttle, and yet somehow she remained mysterious, protecting her secret self, the self that wrote and dreamed.</p> <p>I visited her a couple of times in her Leicester home – a house crammed with objects, paintings on every wall, flowers in jugs, plants in pots, bowls and cups and knick-knacks and pieces of bric-a-brac everywhere, photographs of her family whose faces she could no longer see and messages she couldn’t read pinned onto the noticeboards, books she could no longer read on shelves and in piles on the floor. After she died, I went back to the house to talk to her family (I’m trained as a humanist celebrant and I conducted her funeral). It was very strange to be in her home – the house that Sue built – without her in it, sitting at the table, exuberant, life-filled, at the heart of things. The place was still full of objects (she was no minimalist) and full of people too, passionately bereft. Her husband, Colin, was there, and her four children and their partners, and also most of her grandchildren – her notion of family was broad and inclusive; home was always a place of welcome. They talked over each other, interrupted and added to each other, all wanting to share their versions of the many-sided Sue Townsend.</p> <p>She was the young girl who’d not learnt to read until eight and left her secondary modern at 15, but who’d devoured Russian, French and American literature and who was never without a book; the tree-climber (she would sit and read in the branches); the beatnik dressed in black; the single mother who had many jobs and no money but who made a feast out of Oxo cubes and tinned peas. She was the wife – Colin recalled their first meeting, when she’d seen him shepherding geese across the road and thought he was a nutter; their first date, when they’d taken her children skating; their holidays together. She was the grandmother, who never locked her door so that the grandchildren could come and go as they pleased and who let them dress up in her finest clothes and tear round the muddy garden. (Her boundless hospitality meant that sometimes there was no room for her and she had to book herself into the hotel down the road to get her books written.) She was the radical <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/13/adrian-mole-sue-townsend-welfare\" title=\"\">who believed in social justice</a> and had 20 or so flying picket miners staying with them during the strike, who took her daughter to Greenham Common, who never let fame and fortune go to her head, who remained a woman of the people. She was the chain smoker, the world’s worst diabetic. The cafe-moocher, partygoer, late-nighter, mahjong player, vodka drinker, Chanel-No-5 and red-lipstick wearer (she would even put lipstick on to have a phone conversation), the beetroot and violet-cream devourer. She was the writer, whose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/apr/11/adrian-moles-best-quotes-what-are-your-favourites\" title=\"\">Adrian Mole diaries </a>entered the national consciousness and who wrote about lives of quiet desperation and made them funny, even poetic. She was the dreamer.</p> <p>As her family shared their memories with me and with each other, as they talked, laughed and wept, what emerged was a woman whose generosity was almost reckless. And yet, in the midst of the warmth and chaos, Sue Townsend maintained her inviolable secret self – her writing self. And although she’s gone, although that house no longer has its centre, that self remains. Open any of her books and there she is: the unbeatable, unmistakeable, irreplaceable, unforgettable Sue.</p>","wordcount":"715","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-24T09:00:10Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/4488n"},"tags":[{"id":"books/sue-townsend","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Sue Townsend","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/sue-townsend","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/sue-townsend","references":[]},{"id":"theobserver/series/obituaries-of-2014","type":"series","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webTitle":"Obituaries of 2014","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/series/obituaries-of-2014","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/series/obituaries-of-2014","references":[],"description":"The Observer's look back at some of those who died in 2014, remembered by those who knew them best"},{"id":"books/books","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"Books","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/books","references":[]},{"id":"tone/features","type":"tone","webTitle":"Features","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/features","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tone/features","references":[]},{"id":"culture/adrian-mole","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Adrian Mole","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/adrian-mole","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/adrian-mole","references":[]},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Culture","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/culture","references":[]},{"id":"culture/comedy","type":"keyword","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webTitle":"Comedy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/comedy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/comedy","references":[]},{"id":"type/article","type":"type","webTitle":"Article","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/articles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/type/article","references":[]},{"id":"profile/niccigerrard","type":"contributor","webTitle":"Nicci Gerrard","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/niccigerrard","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/profile/niccigerrard","references":[],"bio":"<p>Nicci Gerrard is a novelist and author of Soham: A Story Of Our Times.

gap between what was said and what was done","byline":"Richard Coles","body":"<p><strong>While studying for ordination at the College of the Resurrection in Yorkshire, the Reverend Richard Coles chaperoned the crime writer on one of her visits there.</strong></p> <p>“Call me Phyllis! While I’m here!” announced Baroness James of Holland Park on arrival at the College of the Resurrection in Mirfield, West Yorkshire, where I was studying for ordination. Better known as PD James, she had come to research life in such places for her murder mystery <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/04/crime.pdjames1\" title=\"\"><em>Death in Holy Orders</em></a>. A clever choice, for life in religious communities is exacting and unsparing and as the Superior at the monastery we were attached to once said, “If there was a murder here there would be 50 suspects at least.”</p> <p>Lifting the lid on the darker aspects of life therein can be risky – I have done the same in <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/fathomless-riches.html\" title=\"\">my own memoir</a> published this year – so her presence, while exciting, was also a little discomfiting and we were on our best behaviour. So was she, unfailingly, but while <em>toujours la politesse </em>prevailed I could tell simply from the way she looked at people that she was alert for the gaps between theory and practice, between what was said and what was done; a characteristic one might expect to find in a crime writer.</p> <p>It was my job to be her chaperone, to show her round again, to sit beside her at the principal’s table in the refectory, to be her walker at impromptu sherry parties, to deliver her to services in church, often a minefield for the uninitiated, monastic liturgies having none of the pointers to standing up and sitting down and finding your place that many seem to like. She was unfazed by these, quite content to sit and listen and pray while we got on with the chanting of the psalms and the offering of the prayers. She understood, as someone familiar with high church ways, that this division of labour was not intended to exclude but to diversify. Besides, she was there as an observer, to capture the detail and atmosphere of such places, and in the interests of research had also visited another high church college at Oxford, our great rival, so we read the book and watched the television adaptation with slightly competitive interest.</p> <p>In the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/arts/critic/feature/0,,1160447,00.html\" title=\"\"> television version</a> we all gave a sharp intake of breath when we saw the ordinands at her fictional college wearing white instead of black scapulars to serve in the refectory – that’s us, we exclaimed – but she also captured the febrile atmosphere not only of our college but of our rival too, vibrant with gossip and tense with <em>odium theologicum</em>, the professional hatreds peculiar to our calling, which so unmake the common life that we are obliged to try to live. I wondered how aggressive a combatant she might have been in those had she been a participant rather than a spectator, for she was a true conservative as well as a Conservative. But she was Phyllis, not Baroness James, on that occasion, and it is as Phyllis I will remember her; curious, courteous, perspicacious.</p>","wordcount":"514","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-10T15:39:00Z","commentable":"true","productionOffice":"UK","shortUrl":"https://gu.com/p/448tj"},"tags":[{"id":"books/pdjames","type":"keyword","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webTitle":"PD
