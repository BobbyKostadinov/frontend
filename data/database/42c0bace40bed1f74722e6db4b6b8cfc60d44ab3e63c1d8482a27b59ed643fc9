His name was David Hawkes.</p> <p>A gifted linguist, he had directed Japanese codebreakers in his early 20s, during the second world war. As a student at Peking University, he had been in Tiananmen Square in 1949 when Mao proclaimed the People’s Republic of China. Later, as a teacher, he had done a wonderful translation of the <em>Songs of the South</em>, part of a poetic tradition earlier than anything that has survived in the west. Then he became professor of Chinese in Oxford, but, as he put it, “I resigned in order to devote my time to translating a Chinese novel … well, <em>the</em> Chinese novel”.</p> <p>The book was <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/story-of-the-stone.html\"><em>Dream of the Red Chamber</em>, also known as <em>The Story of the Stone</em></a>, written by Cao Xuequin. The critic Anthony West called it “one of the great novels of world literature … to the Chinese as Proust is to the French or Karamazov to the Russians”.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c6ca3b5c0bd79c3599e44f2d2af7215d5e04e62\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/6c6ca3b5c0bd79c3599e44f2d2af7215d5e04e62/0_0_750_428/500.jpg\" alt=\"An illustration from the book\" width=\"500\" height=\"285\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An illustration from the book</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hawkes eventually completed his great endeavour with the help of his son-in-law <a href=\"http://www.johnminford.com/\">John Minford</a>, who finished the last two volumes of the five, which were published by Penguin between 1973 and 1986. Hawkes’s translation was greeted as an introduction to “a masterpiece”, a “work of genius”, a “candidate for the Book of the Millennium”. When Chinese premier <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/wen-jiabao\">Wen Jiabo</a> was given a copy of Shakespeare during his state visit to the UK last year, the new Chinese ambassador <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/fu-ying\">Fu Ying</a> gave the queen the Hawkes translation.</p> <p>The novel is an 18th-century saga, the tale of a noble family that falls from grace. It is full of incredible detail of the social, cultural and spiritual life of the time. Chairman Mao claimed to have read it five times – and thought everyone else should too. Today, everyone in China knows it, partly due to the much-loved 1987 TV version, which had the impact of the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> in the UK.</p> <p><em>Dream of the Red Chamber</em> was written in the 1750s “by a great artist with his very lifeblood”, said Hawkes. Cao’s story mirrors the tale of his own family. His grandfather, Cao Yin, was an imperial bondservant, an important functionary in the south, who enjoyed high favour with the emperor Kangxi. But after Kangxi died, his son began a purge of corruption and incompetence, and the family were ruined. They lost their mansion in Nanjing and moved to a modest house among the alleys of Beijing, south-east of the Forbidden City.</p> <p>So Yin’s grandson grew up in straitened circumstances, a brilliant but watchful boy, wary of all power, and never forgetting his grandad’s saying about the fickleness of fortune: “When the tree falls, the monkeys will be scattered.” He was good with the brush, both with paint and with words: but he had no aptitude for university, so he found himself down and out in his 30s, selling his paintings and working as a private teacher (he was eventually sacked for getting a maidservant pregnant.) By the end he was sleeping in barns and working in wine shops; he clearly drank too much.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"526857d2cf940ebc3b4748beb29f8b2edf7fe5b3\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/526857d2cf940ebc3b4748beb29f8b2edf7fe5b3/0_0_500_330/500.jpg\" alt=\"A performance of Dream of the Red Chamber at the Cairo Opera House in 2010.\" width=\"500\" height=\"330\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A performance of <em>Dream of the Red Chamber</em> at the Cairo Opera House in 2010.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The book was written in dribs and drabs: each new chapter circulated among family and friends, often in exchange for a meal and a pitcher of wine. He died in 1763, heartbroken it is said, by the death of his only son. <em>Death of the Red Chamber</em> was finally published in print in 1791, but the text is still surrounded by controversy. There is a story that it had been censored because eminent people it satirised had been too thinly disguised. It is also debated whether the text we have is all his. Different endings survive, with a writer called Gao E claiming to have published the complete version according to the author’s wishes. Today, “redology” (<em>Red Chamber</em> obsessives are known as “redologists”) is a massive and still expanding field in China, with conferences, annual journals and a torrent of publications. Manuscripts still turn up. Mysteries remain unsolved.</p> <p>Hawkes’s version gives us the first 80 chapters by Cao and the last 40 redacted by Gao E, who it seems fair to assume was using an unfinished draft and clearly knew what the author had planned. It is a different kind of novel from earlier Chinese classics such as <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/three-kingdoms.html\"><em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</em></a>, <em>The Water Margin</em> and <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/monkey-7.html\"><em>Monkey</em></a>, the latter a vast sprawling narrative, surreal and poignant, full of songs and poems. The female characters are especially strong. As Cao himself said: “Having made an utter failure of my life, one day I found myself in the midst of my poverty and wretchedness, thinking about the female companions of my youth. As I went over them in my mind’s eye one by one it suddenly came over me that those slips of girls – which is all they were then – were in every way, both morally and intellectually, superior to the ‘grave and moustachioed signor’ I am now supposed to have become. The realisation brought with it an overpowering sense of shame … And I resolved then, however unsightly my shortcomings might be, I must not, for the sake of keeping them hid, allow those wonderful girls to pass into oblivion without a memorial.”</p> <p>The book as it stands in the Penguin version runs to 2,500 pages – twice as long as <em>War and Peace</em>. Hard going at first because of the myriad characters (there are 40 main ones) and their (to a non-Chinese eye) difficult names. But once you are into it, it is a book into which the reader can completely immerse herself; it is like nothing else in all of literature. Having just watched his thrilling adaptation of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/war-and-peace\"><em>War and Peace</em></a>, all I can say is: “Over to you, Andrew Davies.”</p>

transition’","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>On 28 January 2016, the Guardian teen transgender chat took place (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/live/2016/jan/28/webchat-transgender-teen-ya-fiction\">you can read it here</a>) and I decided to observe it. Not participate, simply observe. After reading Robin Talley’s What We Left Behind, I realised that there was a whole world out there that I had never paid much attention to and a very important one at that. </p> <p>The Art of Being Normal (I’m ashamed to say) is only the second book that I’ve read from the world of LGBTQIA, but with all of my newfound knowledge from playing silent spectator during the chat, I feel like I can now properly review this book...</p> <p>What if you were a man stuck in a woman’s body?</p> <p>What if you were a women stuck in a man’s body?</p> <p>I used to think that it wasn’t that big a deal, but I’ll be happy to kick myself should anyone demand it. Most of society, even a decade ago, would have deemed it as people not being able to make up their minds – just like bisexuals – but change is coming and The Art of Being Normal is evidence of that change.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"58f1c171d74ef893609d822b1f2c590edb02b24a\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/58f1c171d74ef893609d822b1f2c590edb02b24a/0_0_315_475/315.jpg\" alt=\"The Art of Being Normal\" width=\"315\" height=\"475\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Leo Denton is the new boy in school. There is a rumour that he murdered someone with a hacksaw, and then he got expelled. Now a popular girl is interested in him, and Leo likes her too, but when you used to be Megan Denton, not everything is simple.</p> <p>David is your garden variety high–school outcast. With his best friends, they lead a pretty normal life. Except for the fact that David abhors the body he was born in; except for the fact that David wants to be a girl.</p> <p>This is not a love story. This is a story of acceptance, of coming out and of transition. It’s about learning to accept yourself, and about standing up for yourself when you need to. It’s about coming out to everyone who used to think of you as someone else altogether and then actually looking in the mirror and getting used to what you look like now! </p> <p>While I was reading about how covers of books with these powerful messages don’t have to be so obvious, and how stories are being released in which the transition isn’t the main element, I felt a little disconnected from The Art Of Being Normal. It was a good story, a GREAT story, it just didn’t make me feel much.</p> <p>Not the friendship between Leo and David, not the blossoming love between Alicia and Leo, or even that intense need to transform yourself to another gender, all of which I would have expected to find, and I was a tad disappointed!</p> <p>And yet, if it wasn’t clear enough already, I respect this book and everything it stands for. I loved the idea of the characters, the idea of their friendship, their family lives, their friends, even how they realised that there would always be people that belittled them for who they are, but together they could make it– just not the execution of these ideas.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

The reasons for this lie deep in its mongrel DNA. This is a smoggy, shadowy period drama paced like a soap opera. It is a bizarre mashup; characters from seven Dickens novels cross paths and live cheek by jowl. It is full of murder and misery and human trafficking – and it is on before the watershed.</p> <p>Dickensian refuses to settle for the comforting storylines of shows such as Cold Feet or Last Tango in Halifax, where family ties and friendship can overcome even the worst crises. When bad things happen here, there is a sense that the characters could easily fall through a trapdoor and never clamber back out.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/30/charles-dickens-dickensian-bbc-novels\">I thought I’d outgrown Dickens – but Dickensian made me think again | Stephen Moss</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tony Jordan’s mishmash adaptation is something new (albeit built on something very old) – making it almost inevitable that it would divide audiences. </p> <p>You may have been spending happy half-hours hurling abuse at the dastardly Meriwether Compeyson (Tom Weston-Jones) or quietly mourning (minor Great Expectations spoiler) Amelia Havisham (Tuppence Middleton). Or you may have decided you don’t want any more, sir. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8740588194c11dd04da2f8be64f8dde532db5278\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/8740588194c11dd04da2f8be64f8dde532db5278/0_0_4283_2801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amelia Havisham (Tuppence Middleton) with Arthur Havisham (Joseph Quinn)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"654\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amelia Havisham (Tuppence Middleton) with Arthur Havisham (Joseph Quinn) .</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Liam Daniel/BBC/Red Planet Productions/Liam Daniel</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br />Granted, there are moments when the pace slows and it is unclear why you are even being shown scenes at all. The sweetly played attraction between youngsters Nell (Imogen Faires) and Peter Cratchit (Brenock O’Connor), for instance, never seems to go anywhere. </p> <p>Then again, a surprise may lie ahead here, because one of the biggest risks Dickensian takes is to demand that you pay the utmost attention; any fleeting look could foretell a major moment. Considering that it is going out in the undemanding world of early-evening TV, this is brave. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/shortcuts/2015/dec/20/dickensian-bbc1-literary-characters-live-forever\">Dickensian: please, sir, can we have some more characters?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If Dickensian’s worst of times come when it ambles, its best of times occur when Stephen Rea, as Inspector Bucket, is on screen. As he explains to Mr Venus (Omid Djalili), his is a new kind of job: he is a detective, here investigating the murder of Jacob Marley (Peter Firth). Bucket is sceptical without being a cynic, and ahead of his time in his methodology – a bit like Ripper Street’s Edmund Reid, but more shop-soiled and far less anguished. To put this in less luvvy terms: Bucket is a 19th-century Columbo. </p> <p>But it is not just as a whodunnit that Dickensian is edgy. In so many of its storylines, as in the novels, cash is king. Lots of people had a motive for killing Marley; he was a moneylender. Spoilt Arthur Havisham (Joseph Quinn) can’t bear to miss out on his inheritance. Good Bob Cratchit (Robert Wilfort) longs to help his family more. The financial problems of Edward Barbary (Adrian Rawlins) are pushing his daughter, Honoria (Sophie Rundle), towards a loveless match.</p> <p>In the neverending aftermath of the 2008 crash, where we worry about returning to Victorian levels of inequality, it is an apposite theme, giving contemporary resonance without ever forcing the point. Many of its crimes – people-trafficking and fraud – seem all too contemporary, too. Dickens’ venal London might not be as foreign a place as we imagine.</p> <p>I hope Dickensian gets recommissioned. Just think how it could grow: the leads could go to Paris on holiday and meet the cast of classic French novels.

That assumption was bolstered by the announcement that the book would be the eighth official Harry Potter title, prompting jubilation from Waterstones chief James Daunt, who crowed that there were “no sweeter three words to the ears of a bookseller than ‘the eighth story’.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/10/new-harry-potter-cursed-child-eighth-book-july-play-script\">New Harry Potter book from JK Rowling coming out in July: the play script</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Within 24 hours of the announcement that the script would be released as a book in a global publishing deal involving the UK, the US and Australia, it had soared to No 1 in book charts.</p> <p>It took a perplexed fan to clarify the situation. Victoria Green tweeted JK Rowling to say that she had bet her teacher that Rowling would “‘not write, publish, or announce another novel about Harry Potter before May 1 2017’, who wins? Only you can decide.”</p> <p>While the marketers of the book may have been being economical with the <em>actualité</em>, Rowling was happy to set things straight, replying: “You win! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CursedChild?src=hash\">#CursedChild</a> is a play and while we have worked very closely on it, the wonderful writer is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jackthorne\">@jackthorne</a>.”<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/gillyweedgreen/status/697947857832255490\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jk_rowling\">@jk_rowling</a> My chemistry teacher &amp; I have a 2011 bet to settle.

It is officially the eighth story in Harry Potter canon and a new play by Jack Thorne.”<br /></p> <p>Whoever penned the words on the page, it’s unlikely that Amazon will seeing a slew of cancelled orders, but the confusion does cast light on the delicate issue of collaboration and authorship, which is at its most complicated in scripts for stage or screen.</p> <p>Viewed by Harry Potter diehards, desperate for a new book, the picture of Rowling flanked by director John Tiffany and writer Jack Thorne might indeed seem misleading, but in the context of a stage play, it is a truthful representation of a collaboration in which director and scriptwriter are serving the author’s vision, taking notes from her and filtering them through the lens of their own crafts.<br /></p> <p>In a sense it’s an inversion of the writer-editor relationship in books, with Rowling wielding the blue pencil over the scriptwriter’s work. The resulting script may not be all her own work, but it won’t anyway be a complete work of literature in the sense that an original Harry Potter novel would be.<br /></p> <p>And that may be the real story of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. Not many people read play scripts for fun, for the very good reason that they are created to be performed. For the Potter fans who queue up for the latest midnight release, this realisation may be a rude awakening. Not for nothing does Rowling’s own <a href=\"https://www.pottermore.com/news/ww-publishing-cursed-child-script-book-announcement\">Pottermore website describe it</a> as “a Special Rehearsal Edition of the script book of new stage play”.<br /></p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4gk38","wordcount":"549","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/2e3897438eaaa8993191bff872c50886a06d3101/0_99_1772_1064/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-02-19T00:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>Fans disappointed that the words of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child will be scripted by Jack Thorne haven’t quite understood how playwriting works</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/12/when-is-jk-rowling-not-jk-rowling-when-she-collaborates-harry-potter-cursed-child","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2016/feb/12/when-is-jk-rowling-not-jk-rowling-when-she-collaborates-harry-potter-cursed-child","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"2e3897438eaaa8993191bff872c50886a06d3101","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/2e3897438eaaa8993191bff872c50886a06d3101/0_99_1772_1064/1000.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"© Debra Hurford Brown","mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/2e3897438eaaa8993191bff872c50886a06d3101","altText":"Who’s in charge? ...

It alleges copyright and trademark infringement, and claims that “in writing The Mortal Instruments and the Shadowhunters Series [Clare] knowingly and wilfully copied the Dark-Hunter Series and original elements therein to create a work or works substantially similar to and derivative of the Dark-Hunter Series”.</p> <p>In Clare’s first public response to the accusations, her lawyer John Cahill said: “Cassie was both surprised and disappointed that Ms Kenyon would file this baseless lawsuit, a decade after the debut of Cassie’s books …</p> <p>“Tellingly, the lawsuit failed to identify a single instance of actual copying or plagiarism by Cassie … There is little chance of anyone confusing Cassie’s young adult themes and orientation with the sometimes very adult storylines in Ms Kenyon’s books. Indeed, we expect that all of Ms Kenyon’s claims will be dismissed.”</p> <p>Kenyon, who is seeking damages and lost profits as well as an end to infringement, lays out a range of similarities in plot and character between the two series. Both, she says “employ a line of warriors who protect the normal world from demons”, both cover how “a young person becomes part of the Dark-Hunters’ (or Shadowhunters’) world after being saved by a gorgeous blond Dark-Hunter (or Shadowhunter)”, and “both Dark-Hunters and Shadowhunters have enchanted swords that are divinely forged, imbued with otherworldly spirits, have unique names, and glow like heavenly fire”.</p> <p>Cahill added that Kenyon’s suit “rests on a basic misunderstanding of copyright law and Cassie’s totally original work”.</p> <p>“The law does not protect ideas and myths, it protects only the expression of those ideas,” Cahill’s statement reads. “For instance, Ms Kenyon complains that Cassie stole her idea to use ‘normal objects … imbued with magical properties such as a cup, a sword, and a mirror,’ but those ideas and many others to which Ms Kenyon lays claim have long been part of our storytelling tradition from ancient times to the present.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrdSMN0KnZM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yrdSMN0KnZM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>He pointed to the comment of the historical romance author Courtney Milan, who said earlier this week that “Sherrilyn Kenyon didn’t invent the idea of a band of humans fighting the supernatural”.</p> <p>“In addition, many of the characters and events cited as similar by Kenyon in her lawsuit appeared in Cassie’s works prior to their appearance in Kenyon’s,” said Cahill. “The lawsuit is filled with basic factual inaccuracies about Cassie’s work that would be recognised by any reader of her novels. For example, the lawsuit identifies a main character’s stepfather as her ‘best friend’, alleges that the term ‘daimons’ appears in her books (the word is never used) and claims that one of her main characters is based on a Kenyon character whose similar attributes were first revealed some three years after Cassie had created and told the backstory of the relevant protagonist.”</p> <p>Clare writes on <a href=\"http://www.cassandraclare.com/\">her website</a> that she came up with the idea for her series in a tattoo shop, which had the footprints of everyone who had worked there marked on the ceiling in black paint: “To me it looked like some fabulous supernatural battle had been fought there by beings who’d left their footprints behind. I started thinking about a magical battle in a New York tattoo shop and the idea of a secret society of demon-hunters whose magic was based on an elaborate system of tattooed runes just sprang into my mind.”</p> <p>In January this year, a TV series based on the Shadowhunters novels began screening on Netflix in the UK and ABC Family in the US. </p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4gkv3","wordcount":"649","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/1aba5a5762b84fbe4a2ac485807cd6237f7e4c26/0_0_620_372/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-02-19T00:00:00Z","standfirst":"<p>Clare’s lawyer issues statement that the young adult fantasy novelist expects ‘all of Ms Kenyon’s claims will be dismissed’ </p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/12/cassandra-clare-hits-back-at-sherrilyn-kenyons-lawsuit-alleging-copying","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2016/feb/12/cassandra-clare-hits-back-at-sherrilyn-kenyons-lawsuit-alleging-copying","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"1aba5a5762b84fbe4a2ac485807cd6237f7e4c26","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/1aba5a5762b84fbe4a2ac485807cd6237f7e4c26/0_0_620_372/500.jpg","typeData":{"mediaApiUri":"https://api.media.gutools.co.uk/images/1aba5a5762b84fbe4a2ac485807cd6237f7e4c26","altText":"Cassandra Clare.","caption":"‘Surprised and disappointed’ ...

forthcoming TV adaptation of four short stories by the fantasy writer Neil Gaiman. The show will feature an original score written by former Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker.</p> <p>Veteran actor Kenneth Cranham, comic Johnny Vegas and 60s kitchen-sink drama doyenne <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/jun/15/artsfeatures\">Rita Tushingham</a> will head up Likely Stories, which will be broadcast on Sky Arts later this year.</p> <p>The younger stars include: Tom Hughes, who will also appear in the forthcoming TV biopic of Queen Victoria starring Doctor Who’s Jenna Coleman; George MacKay (Pride, Sunshine on Leith), who was nominated for a Rising Star Bafta in 2014; and Simon Manyonda, most recently in Doctor Who. Monica Dolan, who also starred in Pride, Kick-Ass 2 and BBC comedy series W1A, Paul Ritter (Quantum of Solace, Wolf Hall) and Johann Myers, star of Black Mirror and No Offence, complete the ensemble cast, which will play across all four, 30-minute episodes. </p> <p>Gaiman is the author of several novels and short stories currently being adapted for TV and cinema. His debut novel, American Gods, is being turned into a TV series by the US channel Starz, starring Ricky Whittle and produced by Hannibal’s Bryan Fuller. The short story <a href=\"http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/how-to-talk-to-girls-at-parties/31245/elle-fanning-to-star-in-neil-gaimans-how-to-talk-to-girls-at-parties\">How to Talk to Girls at Parties</a> is also headed for the big screen with Nicole Kidman. </p> <p>Likely Stories producers Sid Gentle Films, which began production of the series in November under the directorship of Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard (the duo behind the Nick Cave film <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20,000_Days_on_Earth\">20,000 Days on Earth</a>) have now released details of the four stories.</p> <p>Foreign Parts, from Gaiman’s first collection Smoke and Mirrors, will appeal to fans of Charlie Brooker’s twisted Black Mirror. It’s about an introverted banker who begins to believe his genitals are no longer part of him, and are slowly taking him over. </p> <p>Feeders and Eaters, from the Fragile Things collection, is about the relationship between a man and an old woman who has very unusual appetites.</p> <p>Closing Time, from the same book, is an almost <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._R._James\">MR James</a>-style story of a man spinning a tall tale of haunted houses to the members of his gentleman’s club.</p> <p>Looking for the Girl, also from Smoke and Mirrors, focuses on a man with a lifelong fixation on a model in a porn magazine. But as he gets older, she somehow stays the same age.</p> <p>Phil Edgar-Jones, director of Sky Arts, said, “I’ve long admired the work of Neil Gaiman. He is a genius storyteller and an exceptional talent. Under this British directorial powerhouse, Likely Stories is, in true Gaiman style, brilliantly bizarre and unexpected.”</p> <p>All of the stories are set in London and will, according to the production team, hold a few Easter eggs for Gaiman fans, while the author himself will be making a Hitchcockian appearance in each episode.</p> <p>Gaiman said: “Short stories do not traditionally get a lot of love from TV. I’m really excited to see what the team are going to do – they’ve given it real thought and it feels like it’ll be very, very special.”</p> <p>According to executive producer Sally Woodward Gentle, Likely Stories – despite its Black Mirror feel and the nod to the classic Roald Dahl’s Tales of the Unexpected – “is like nothing else on TV”. She said: “Each film explores common themes of human consumption, destructive obsession and psychological cannibalism – with great humour and humanity.”</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4gjpf","wordcount":"571","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/8b5ab76ecb69e3ab00f749ccf3da5b39eb007113/0_627_7052_4231/140.jpg","standfirst":"<p>Rita

When they settle in the human world and stop worrying, for example, about trying to teach their children (Betty and Bobby) to act like humans, all different kinds of chaos starts. </p> <p>The neighbours are getting nosy; some secrets are being found out because the Bolds forget to hide their hyena habits and the neighbour is watching the Bolds in his spare time. Can they save an old hyena, Tony, from the safari park and does he become a part of the Bolds family? </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\"

</a><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/british-library\">British Library</a>, in a series about conservation of documents and records. The speaker was an American military researcher. He was endearing, open and delighted to tell us about his skills. He spent his time retrieving hard disks from dumps and painstakingly storing the data of conversations and communications. He said he could assemble a complete record of all the possible communications between a whole community – a town, a city. He told us how very easy it was to crack into even the most complex saved information. Some of his audience – the younger, on the whole – found this exciting. Some like me were horrified.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/patrick-flanery\">Patrick Flanery</a>’s title is riddling and perfectly chosen. It means several things at once. His central character (hardly a hero) suspects that he is the object of intense surveillance for which there is no reason – he is no one of any political or social importance. He is Jeremy O’Keefe, an American academic who has spent time teaching in Oxford and conveys a transatlantic uncertainty in his speech and habits. He is divorced, with an American daughter, and finds it hard to form new relationships. He receives a series of anonymous packages which turn out to contain printed records of all his contacts and messages. Someone is treating him as though he is someone. Who? And why?</p> <p>Flanery has taken a big risk in telling Jeremy’s tale in the first person. Jeremy is a kind of social and emotional nonentity, who shows only a limited interest in the life of the mind, and only an inhibited interest in other people. He is vaguely anxious and not very likable. The reader cannot either feel with him or dislike him. But Flanery is a master of puzzling, alarming and even terrifying storytelling. As Jeremy’s predicament intensifies – watchers across the road, followers in the street, interference with his appointments, at one point a lost mobile phone rediscovered in the refrigerator with the message “phones listen” on its screen – we realise that Jeremy’s plight is at least in part an aspect of a much larger one. We live in a time where there is no longer any <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/privacy\">privacy</a>. Everything is recorded and shared, permanently available to those who pry or, as they may think of it, research.</p> <p>Jeremy has a conversation with his possible follower, who may be a friend or a foe, about recording his students’ habits – reading, writing, seminar attendance. During this Jeremy bursts out passionately:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Frankly it [digital tracking of students] gives me chills. Privacy is the last thing we have. Privacy with a book most of all. When I sit down and read a book I don’t want anyone else to know how long it’s taken me to read a page, what I’ve written about it, whether I’ve skimmed a paragraph too quickly to recall its contents clearly. You’re imagining a world where even thought is a matter of public record. It’s grotesque.</p> </blockquote> <p>One of the pleasures of reading Flanery is the tussle between ways of understanding the shapes of stories and language. He mixes, to quote an interview he gave, “expressionism, symbolism, surrealism” into what he calls “critical realism” – he writes realist novels which show their awareness that realism is a self-conscious form like others. Reviewers have described his novels as thrillers, which is never quite right – but there are parts of the story that stand out as thrilling, next to other parts that are meditative, and others that are psychologically baffling. Readers are constantly seeking to work out what sort of writing they are reading. For instance, many of the chapters end with the kind of statement – “As you will see, I had things to find out … ” – that suggests the construction of a thriller and doesn’t quite fit with what has gone on before. His life is further complicated by an uncertain relationship, in Oxford, with an Egyptian woman from a powerful family. He has edged into a world of real secret onlooking.</p> <p>When we learn – late into the story – the subject of Jeremy’s research, our ideas shift again. He has published extensively on the surveillance by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/13/east-germany-stasi-files-zirndorf\">Stasi in East Germany</a>, who made those they were investigating – almost everyone – into reluctant investigators of each other. Moreover he tells us that his obsession with privacy derives from a childhood desperation about bathroom privacy. He is, it turns out, “not just a neurotic, but one of the world’s leading experts on surveillance”. Some of the things he tells us conflict with other stories he has told. We are even less sure what kind of stories we are being told.</p> <p>• <em>I am No One by Patrick Flanery</em> (Atlantic Books, £12.99).

It’s an ecstatic evocation of Caribbean life","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>A <em>House for Mr Biswas</em> is episodic and packed with conflict. Mr Biswas subverts heroic convention: he is smart and funny, but also often petulant, mean and unsympathetic. His enemies, who are mostly his relatives, are largely unlikable, but they also have their admirable moments. The narrative of the novel is propelled by a clear goal – the acquisition of the titular house – which, it becomes apparent, can only be achieved by the most exhaustively circuitous route. It is a novel of epic length, formal perfection, and contains two notable peculiarities: its setting, which, being domestic, is unusual for an epic; and its geographical location, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/trinidad-and-tobago\" title=\"\">Trinidad</a>, an important island in the Caribbean but not a particularly influential one on the world stage. And yet, this severely delimited context gave VS Naipaul an entire world of experience and feeling on which to draw. <em>A House for Mr Biswas</em>, published in 1961, is one of the imperishable novels of the 20th century.</p> <p>From his birth until his untimely death 46 years later, Mr Biswas mostly lives in a series of houses that either do not belong to him or are houses unworthy of the name. Each of these houses is for Mr Biswas an attempt at solving a problem, and each is a wrong answer in a different way. Mr Biswas is like a figure out of myth – and indeed his birth is attended by negative portents and dour prophecies; he is declared to be “born in the wrong way”, seems doomed to live through each of these futile iterations before his destiny can be complete. The pointlessness and the wasted effort of these dead-end attempts give the novel a comic edge that links it both to picaresque and to the existentialist tradition.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6de7743ba59447e1c62562adeb643700c9faea3\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/d6de7743ba59447e1c62562adeb643700c9faea3/0_0_2426_2213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An entire world of experience on which to draw … VS Naipaul in the 1960s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"912\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An entire world of experience on which to draw … VS Naipaul in the 1960s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Minihan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Futility is the way home. In the search Mr Biswas carries his meagre possessions and his growing family along, from one unsuitable house to another, from Hanuman House to the Chase to Green Vale to Shorthills to a rental in Port of Spain. These residences are mere walls and roofs to Mr Biswas. His tragedy is not only that none of them is a house for him, but that his awareness of the poor fit is acute and constant. Most of the houses belong to his despised in-laws, the Tulsis. A couple of them are built by Mr Biswas himself, but these are swiftly undermined by their shoddiness and by elemental threat: one succumbs to flood, the other to fire. Even an expensive doll’s house he buys for his daughter Savi quickly ends up a splintered wreck. Brutal ironies dog Mr Biswas every step of the way on life’s journey, the unfairness mounts intolerably; and yet it is a funny book, too, full of jagged capers, lively malice, clever talk.</p> <p>The novel opens with relief: Mr Biswas has found his house. How terrible it would have been, he thinks, to have failed in this quest, “to have lived without even attempting to lay claim to one’s portion of the earth; to have lived and died as one had been born, unnecessary and unaccommodated”. In the long search for this accommodation – the what and why having been answered in the prologue, the novel’s course is about the how – Mr Biswas finds various lesser stratagems in which he can be temporarily housed. It begins with his name: not the “Mohun Biswas” inscribed belatedly on his birth certificate by a solicitor, but the “Mr Biswas” by which we know him, right from the cradle. Mr Biswas faces many humiliations, but is rarely shorn of the modicum of dignity the honorific guarantees. The retention of this proper form of address is both comic and tense, particularly in the early sections of the novel.</p> <blockquote> In the days that followed [his birth] Mr Biswas was treated with attention and respect. His brothers and sisters were slapped if they disturbed his sleep, and the flexibility of his limbs was regarded as a matter of importance. <br /> </blockquote> <p>A schoolboy is rarely singled out from his siblings and mates in this way, much less a babe in arms. But the perpetual Mr proves a shelter for Mr Biswas. On the rare occasions at which someone calls him by his first name, there’s a slight shock to both Mr Biswas and the reader, as though at a sudden solecism. For instance, at the office of the solicitor with his mother’s sister Tara:</p> <blockquote> “Name of boy?” <br />“Mohun,” Tara said. <br />Mr Biswas became shy. He passed his tongue above his upper lip and tried to make it touch the knobby tip of his nose. </blockquote> <p>It is as though, even at a pre-school age, Mr Biswas knows that the “Mr” is a precious possession of which he should not be casually deprived.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"796edc2b9b5c0ea4b8ee9995f5f18d905373feb9\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/796edc2b9b5c0ea4b8ee9995f5f18d905373feb9/0_0_989_1500/659.jpg\" alt=\"The cover of VS Naipaul's A House for Mr Biswas\" width=\"659\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">VS Naipaul</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Literature is a second form of protection. Most important are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/apr/05/featuresreviews.guardianreview6\" title=\"\">Marcus Aurelius</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/28/stoic-week-stiff-upper-lip\" title=\"\">Epictetus</a>, whom Mr Biswas brandishes apotropaically. Were he to actually adopt their stoic precepts, his experience of life would be different. As it is, they serve him as defensive consolation, a carapace for his irredeemably querulous nature. Mr Biswas himself nurtures the dream of literature. He writes, assembling the dream of writing from its basic building blocks, converting form into imagination. Schoolboy calligraphy becomes sign-writing. Sign-writing becomes journalism. Journalism edges towards something more lasting.</p> <p>And Mr Biswas buys things, he acquires things, his wife, Shama, owns things of her own. Hemmed in by dissent and discord, given to complaint, Mr Biswas marvels at “the endurance and uncomplainingness of inanimate objects”; and these many objects, which he houses, house him too. Gradually, they increase in number and presence, and at several points in the novel, the reader is given an updated inventory of what has been acquired and by what logic. These inventories, which may bring to mind the catalogue of ships in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/feb/09/can-homers-iliad-speak-across-the-centuries\" title=\"\"><em>Iliad</em></a> or the many descriptions of rooms by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/charlesdickens\" title=\"\">Dickens</a>, are markers of Mr Biswas’s modest progress. Moving from the Chase, Mr Biswas and Shama find that they cannot move out as they had moved in, with a donkey cart.</p> <blockquote> These disregarded years had been years of acquisition … They had acquired a kitchen safe of white wood and netting. This too had been awkward to varnish and had been painted. One leg was shorter than the others and had to be propped up; now they knew without thinking that they must never lean on the safe or handle it with violence. They had acquired a hatrack, not because they possessed hats, but because it was a piece of furniture all but the very poor had. <br />As a result, Mr Biswas acquired a hat. And they had acquired, at Shama’s insistence, a dressingtable, the work of a craftsman, french-polished, with a large, clear mirror. </blockquote> <p>Slowly, tentatively, with appalling setbacks, Mr Biswas is no longer one of the very poor. Later, there’s a rockingchair, then a cherished Slumberking bed. (The adjective-noun compounds are a special feature of Mr Biswas’s furnishings, as though to intensify the particularity of each item.) Then comes a delicate glass cabinet, which immediately loses one of its glass doors. The final time the family moves, to the house for Mr Biswas on Sikkim Street in Port of Spain, the number of things has become impressive.</p> <blockquote> The gatherings of a lifetime: the kitchen safe (encrusted with varnish, layer after layer of it, and paint of various colours, the wire-netting broken and clogged), the yellow kitchen table, the hatrack with the futile glass and broken hooks, the rockingchair, the fourposter (dismantled and unnoticeable), Shama’s dressingtable (standing against the cab, without its mirror, with all the drawers taken out, showing the unstained, unpolished wood inside, still, after all these years, so raw, so new), the bookcase and desk, Théophile’s bookcase, the Slumberking (a pink, intimate rose on the headrest), the glass cabinet (rescued from Mrs Tulsi’s drawingroom), the destitute’s diningtable (on its back, its legs roped around, loaded with drawers and boxes), the typewriter (still a brilliant yellow, on which Mr Biswas was going to write articles for the English and American Press, on which he had written his articles for the Ideal School, the letter to the doctor): the gatherings of a lifetime for so long scattered and even unnoticed, now all together on the tray of the lorry. <br /> </blockquote> <p>These moments of inventory are among the most indelible passages in this masterwork of realism: one scarcely credits the idea that such meticulous and loving checklists could be invention. These things must have had these lives, and so they paradoxically underscore the veracity of Mr Biswas’s own experiences. But the realism of the human interactions throughout the novel is similarly irresistible. Here they all are: Mr Biswas, his mother, Bipti, his brothers and sister, his aunt, Tara, and her husband, Ajodha, his wife, Shama, his children (Savi, Anand, Myna, Kamla, appearing one by one, becoming real before our eyes, and being themselves actively drawn into the contest of life), his aggravating in-laws: Mrs Tulsi, Seth, Padma, the indulged sons of the family, the absurdly numerous daughters, their husbands, their children; and the huge cataract of secondary and tertiary characters, the innominate crowd. All are convincingly themselves, and yet all are contained in the arc of the novel, brought in to play their parts in the story of Mr Biswas’s life.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/08/100-best-novels-bend-in-the-river-vs-naipaul-review\">The 100 best novels: No 90 – A Bend in the River by VS Naipaul (1979)</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Incident, fight, rancour, subterfuge: this is Mr Biswas’s experience during the long years he lives with the Tulsis. His principal foes are his mother-in-law, Mrs Tulsi, and her brother-in-law, Seth. They hold grudges against him, and he out-grudges them. He bickers, insults, mocks. His wife, Shama, no fool, plays both sides skilfully, siding with her husband sometimes, abandoning him at other times. Some of these battles of will Mr Biswas wins, others he loses. Physical violence is commonplace: the frequent beatings the children in the extended household receive also spill over, rarely but astonishingly, into adult interaction. Pointless impasse is common. <em>A House for Mr Biswas</em> hums along to the interweaving tunes of these several discords. But the book is also a patient, almost ecstatic evocation, of landscape and social life in Trinidad in the first half of the 20th century. And if the human interactions are characterised by agony, the times and places – the farms, the roads, the villages, the thrumming energy of the city, the mornings, afternoons, dusks, nights – are described with profound and vigilant affection. Playing the angry and fast-moving currents of badinage against the dreamy swirl of memory, the novel’s flow is one of full-bore local savvy. One finally reads or rereads <em>Mr Biswas</em> for this balanced totality, this fecund complexity, for the way it brings to startling fruition in 20th‑century Trinidad the promise of the 19th‑century European novel.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"095bff1ba28ee465ac290072c4181dd3c7fd1929\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/095bff1ba28ee465ac290072c4181dd3c7fd1929/0_0_1370_2055/667.jpg\" alt=\"‘The thrumming energy of the city’ … dancers at the Trinidad carnival.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘The thrumming energy of the city’ … dancers at the Trinidad carnival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Great in macrocosm, the novel is also flawless in microcosm. It contains many perfect set pieces, strewn like jewels through the book, in which the prose gleams with a kind of secret knowledge. Many are the moments of imaginative sympathy that continue to bloom in the mind long after the page is turned. One such account, of the burning of <a href=\"http://darkroom.baltimoresun.com/2014/02/stick-fighting-competition-in-trinidad/#1\" title=\"\">poui sticks</a> for the rough village sport of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IW1iweI3Y0\" title=\"\">stick-fighting</a>, captures the way the scent of the sticks opens up in Mr Biswas a sudden seam of memory.</p> <p>Another, of Mr Biswas working as a bus conductor in his youth, passing by a lone hut in the dusk, is a compressed little masterpiece of longing:</p> <blockquote> In the gloom, a boy was leaning against the hut, his hands behind him, staring at the road. He wore a vest and nothing more. The vest glowed white. In an instant the bus went by, noisy in the dark, through bush and level sugar-cane fields. Mr Biswas could not remember where the hut stood, but the picture remained: a boy leaning against an earth house that had no reason for being there, under the dark falling sky, a boy who didn’t know where the road, and that bus, went. </blockquote> <p>Against that sad obscurity, against surrender, against darkness, <em>A House for Mr Biswas</em> is a book for knowledge, for determination, for ragged unyielding life, a book that, over its great and complex length, shelters the one who reads it.</p> <p>• Reprinted from the forthcoming Picador Classics edition of <em>A House for Mr Biswas</em> by VS Naipaul (published 25 February, £10.99).

strong and deadly currents – described in this subtle memoir","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>By the age of 31, Caroline Jones appeared to be the very definition of a stable and high-achieving woman. She was a documentary producer at the BBC, and her latest film, about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/alzheimers\" title=\"\">Alzheimer’s disease</a>, was nominated for a prestigious award. She had an Oxford degree and a flat in London, and had never had any trouble attracting boyfriends, nor maintaining stable relationships.</p> <p>But beneath the calm surface of her life flowed strong and deadly currents. When she was a teenager at boarding school a fellow student had showed her how to binge on food, and then throw it up afterwards. The habit, which she soon recognised as the eating disorder <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/bulimia\" title=\"\">bulimia</a>, became a psychological crutch, a way of managing “strange, leaking-out” feelings. The messiness – both physical and emotional – is kept locked away behind the bathroom door; the symptoms are apparent only to those who know where to look (“They think they’ve cleaned it up,” complains a cleaner at the school of the constantly vomit-flecked toilets, “but they always miss a bit right under the rim, so we know they’ve been doing it”).</p> <p>Tidily, considerately, avoiding any panic or fuss, Jones concealed the extent of her illness from everyone, even her closest family, for 14 years. On bad days at Oxford, she would shut her curtains and cram down bagfuls of cream cakes, custard, biscuits and chocolate. After vomiting, she would place all the wrappers carefully in the bin and tidy her room; by the time she opened the curtains again everything was perfectly spick and span. There were moments when the chaos threatened to spill out – she was arrested after shoplifting cream cakes for a binge – but she smartly talked her way out of trouble, both with the police and the university authorities. She graduated with a good degree.</p> <p>At the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc\" title=\"\">BBC</a>, she would sometimes start to binge before she had even left the office. “Nobody notices if I lift out one chocolate bar after another, one biscuit at a time, head down, working, diligent.” It felt good to let go, to take off her respectable mask and reveal a chaotic, greedy monster, gorging itself on sweet, sticky, garishly coloured food. It would only be later, purged and sore in the privacy of her flat, that she looked in the mirror and despaired.</p> <p>Eating disorders can seem bizarre, even infuriating, to people fortunate enough never to have suffered from one. Perhaps this is why they remain largely cloaked in shame and silence, while literature abounds with tales of drug and alcohol addiction. Drugs and alcohol are – superficially, of course – more fun. They allow addicts not only to lose control, but to absolve themselves of responsibility for damage caused while under the influence. And addiction can be explained away as a physical dependence, while there is no getting around the fact that the roots of an eating disorder are emotional. Surely, the teenage Jones admonished herself, all she needed to do was find the “strength, self discipline … and the sense, the simple bloody sense, to change things”?</p> <p>Jones did eventually recover during her early 30s, thanks to a therapist at a specialist eating disorder unit. <em>The Spaces in Between</em> is her attempt to unearth the roots of her bulimia, and to explain why strength and self-discipline were not the answer – in fact, they may have been part of the problem. The story that emerges is both fascinating and complex, drawing together Jones’s personal experience and the wider sickness of the world we all live in.</p> <p>Throughout Jones’s childhood her parents were aid workers, and the family moved so many times that she has to include a chronology at the beginning showing their progress from Ethiopia to Lesotho to Kenya to Sudan to Pakistan. It was, in many ways, a privileged existence: they had gardeners and housekeepers, went to private schools, spent holidays camping in game parks and swimming in lakes and oceans. But while they were kept in relative luxury, the family were also intimately involved with the world at its cruellest and most miserable. Her father coordinated medical relief teams for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/international-committee-of-the-red-cross-icrc\" title=\"\">Red Cross</a> during the Biafran war; later he was responsible for getting food to refugees from Rwanda, and to Ugandans fleeing the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/08/joseph-kony-lords-resistance-army\" title=\"\">Lord’s Resistance Army</a>. At times, the chaos surrounding them touched Jones personally – she was sent away to boarding school after Iraqi forces under Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and her school in Pakistan was closed for security reasons – but mainly it formed a backdrop, and served as a constant reminder of how lucky she was, how little grounds she had for feeling sorry for herself.</p> <p>Except that nobody can be perfectly happy all the time, and Jones certainly wasn’t when she arrived at boarding school, in the unfamiliar grey and cold of an English winter, leaving her parents and her bright, exotic life behind. She was convinced that her sadness revealed her to be a terrible, ungrateful person, and set about secretly proving this to herself again and again. The irony of her father alleviating famine on one side of the world and his daughter gorging herself on the other is almost too obvious, and Jones is too subtle a writer to labour it directly. But she does tell us that the key to her recovery was finding compassion, not only for those worse off, but “compassion for myself”.</p> <p>• To order<strong> </strong><em>The Spaces in Between</em><strong> </strong>for £16 (RRP £20) go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/368040/s/the-spaces-in-between//?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

<p>A few of my favourite pages include ones about: the height of a guinea pig’s tooth if it grew for 14 years; how to cook an ostrich egg; a red waterfall in Antarctica; and how amazing the water bear is. </p> <p>One of the best things about this book is that there are facts about so many different things: animals, food, weather etc. There are funny facts, such as what noises animals make in different languages; disgusting facts, such as how much snot you swallow; and sad facts, such as how few tigers there are left in the world. Open any page and you will find something fascinating.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"dddc12eef60eb7d6b5790a46a54313a953750c85\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/dddc12eef60eb7d6b5790a46a54313a953750c85/0_0_325_499/325.jpg\" alt=\"The Epic Book of Epicness\" width=\"325\" height=\"499\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The facts are presented with fun drawings so it should really be called ‘epic pictures’. The good thing about the pictures is that it makes the book easier to share with other people, like my little sister.

What’s in it for them?","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>In December, Amazon US released its 2015 in-house all-format all-category bestseller list, and then the newspaper USA Today came out with its own industry-wide all-sources version. What was the difference? Two words: <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/martian-2.html\"><em>The Martian</em></a> (good movie, but the book was better). It was a huge seller, number 4 on USA Today’s list, but nowhere on Amazon’s. There were other titles in the same anomalous situation. Why?</p> <p>Because, even now, for most books and most people most of the time, the biggest spur to purchase is actually seeing an actual book in a physical place. Because for most people most of the time, reading is a take-it-or-yawn-leave-it activity. Books are not quite distress purchases, but neither are they exciting enough for enthusiastic online hunting. (Again, for most people most of the time, which I’ll stop repeating now, but only if the e-fanboys agree to discuss the real world, not their pretend version. Deal?)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/21/amazon-books-opens-seattle-independent-bookstores\">Seattle bookstores face new threat from Amazon: a brick-and-mortar location</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nothing sells books better than physical displays in bricks-and-mortar locations. Millions of people passed by bookshop windows or airport bookstalls, and saw <em>The Martian</em>, and some vague impression clicked in and they said, “Oh yeah, that’s supposed to be cool”, and they bought a copy, and enjoyed it. Same for the other anomalous titles. That is still how books get sold. Research bears it out. Physical eyeballing is way ahead of any other prompt, be it word of mouth, spam, social media or other kinds of advertising.</p> <p>Which is a problem for Amazon. Classically it uses books to hook customers and then data-mine them. But it gets only dedicated book buyers. Browsing on Amazon isn’t great as a casual experience: fatigue sets in. (How do you make something totally invisible? Put it on page 17 of an internet search.) And Kindle hasn’t taken over the world. It has settled into a solid niche, like those tiny tubes of toothpaste – essential for travel, but no one uses them at home. (Down, fanboys! Real world!) So there is no way for Amazon to replicate that happy, random encounter with a physical bookstore window. Yes, there are bots and algorithms, but those casual millions of three-books-a-year people never see them: they don’t buy books online.</p> <p>Which is a defeat for Amazon. It prides itself on going where the customers are, and doing what the customers want. And it needs to. Its growth demands all the customers there are.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/03/amazon-books-seattle-store-opened-university-village\">Amazon begins a new chapter with opening of first physical bookstore</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So now, rumour has it, Amazon plans to open another 299 physical bookstores (it already has one, in Seattle). The rumours are denied – or at least, not confirmed – and at first glance they appear economically insane. At the best of times, books are low-velocity, low-margin items, and commercial rents are geared to the opposite – clothes, handbags and other high-profit stuff. But then, for 20 years Amazon has proved willing to eat losses, and investors have allowed it to.</p> <p>So, what if? And suppose those 300 stores were only the start? We’d quickly approach a <em>de facto</em> monopsony. Amazon would become the only practical route to market for 1,400 US publishers and a million US self-publishers, for either digital or paper product. The history is worrying. Amazon has already tried to use its power in a punitive fashion, as if determined to hurt publishers financially. All kinds of fees and “contributions” are required. “Pay to play” was openly the name of the game, until Amazon’s lawyers suggested a less explicit description. One publisher resisted, and a senior Amazon executive boasted: “I did everything I could to screw with their performance.” Already, self-publishers have only “terms and conditions”, which change capriciously – so far only to Amazon’s advantage. Is it good public policy to allow one corporation to have total power over a nation’s published output?</p> <ul> <li>Lee Child is a regular Special Guest at the Theakstons Old Peculier Crime Writing Festival; Special Guest tickets are <a href=\"http://www.harrogateinternationalfestivals.com\">now on sale for the 2016 festival</a>, hosted at the Old Swan Hotel, Harrogate, 21-24 July.</li> </ul>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4gjdv","wordcount":"667","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/f9d19498e4c0aaa131a60abc02d60225e8cca979/29_0_4811_2887/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-03-19T14:11:00Z","standfirst":"The world’s biggest online retailer wants to invade the high street.

nearly 30 years – will be the “most radical ever done”, according to the author’s son. </p> <p>“British television has stepped back up to the plate” with this project, said Simon Cornwell, noting that his father, now 84, “always loved the original treatments of his work”, in which Alec Guinness played taciturn spy George Smiley for the BBC. </p> <p>The lavish six-part adaptation of le Carré’s 1993 novel The Night Manager sees Olivia Colman star as “a 21st-century version of Smiley” alongside Hugh Laurie, Tom Hiddleston and Tom Hollander, and arrives on screen later this month. </p> <p>Published in 1993, the novel was quickly optioned by Paramount Studios, but two attempts to make the movie – the second involving Brad Pitt – fizzled out because of the story’s complexity and the difficulty, Cornwell now believes, of cramming the action into a 90-minute movie. </p> <p>The rights then reverted to The Ink Factory, a company set up by Cornwell with his brother Stephen. “When the rights came home we set out to find a partner,” said Cornwell. “We knew it would be a huge, ambitious journey – the BBC had set the bar high with the first adaptation of Tinker Tailor – [but] they came on board unequivocally.” </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de74e64e210fa8083053cdac86093b99f6fbe4b3\"> <img

revenge and guilt; his nemesis, Richard Roper, a bewitching arms dealer dubbed the “worst man in the world”; and the British secret service investigator, bluff, straight-seeing Leonard Burr.</p> <p>In this new adaptation, le Carré’s spy becomes female, with Olivia Colman playing Angela Burr. The setting has also been shifted to 2011 and the Arab Spring, rather than focusing as the book does on murky Central and South American drug warlords. </p> <p>Cornwell said he wondered how his father might react to Burr becoming a woman: “I was steeling myself for an awkward discussion with my father, but he saw instantly it was completely appropriate.”</p> <p>Stephen Garrett, creator of BBC1 hit Spooks and an executive producer on The Night Manager, explained: “Women have been running many of our security services for decades. Le Carré works, in general, are very British and they are very male. Bringing it up to date, it seemed important to have a strong female presence. Essentially, Olivia’s character has become a 21st-century version of Smiley.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"23e9992c4c4795522a7fe75e3cc6ad012b2ed2a1\"> <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/23e9992c4c4795522a7fe75e3cc6ad012b2ed2a1/86_514_1886_1131/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Olivia Coleman as Angela Burr.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Olivia Coleman as Angela Burr.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Des Willie/BBC/The Ink Factory/Des Willie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During their first casting meeting, Colman informed the programme’s Oscar-winning Danish film director Susanna Bier, making her first venture into TV directing, that she was pregnant. </p> <p>“To be perfectly honest, it was a fantastic opportunity because she is the moral heart of the piece,” said Bier. “It gave her a vulnerability – though it worried the insurers.” </p> <p> Costing $30m (£20m), the BBC is partnering with the AMC Network, which made Breaking Bad and Mad Men, on the adaptation – and has put up a third of the budget. Strong international sales are expected. It means the drama is at the top end of global, glossy adaptations: British with international brio. The money can certainly be seen on screen.</p> <p>A fan of Le Carré, Laurie said at a recent screening of the drama that many years ago he had unsuccessfully tried to buy the rights to the book. His aim had been to play the hero, Pine, because the story was “so romantic, noble, stirring and thrilling”. Now, more than 20 years later, he is cast as Roper, playing the older villain, while Hiddleston plays Pine.</p> <p>Laurie explained: “You could, if you chose, read this story as a very ferocious indictment of a particular class, of privilege, money.” His challenge has been to avoid playing the pantomime villain, while exuding superficial charm and a glamorous no-expense-spared lifestyle. “It’s a case of the devil has the good tunes.” </p> <p>He was also specifically asked by the show’s lawyers to desist from approaching arms dealers as he prepared for the role, he revealed. <br /></p> <p>Le Carré has never sanctioned an extension of his works, beyond the books, as returning series – though that is now the great prize for successful TV drama creators. “We are very happy with this collaboration,” says Cornwell. “The BBC is a wonderful, natural home. If it blossoms further, that would be great.” </p> <p>Might that mean a second series of The Night Manager? “I cannot be drawn on it. It’s not off the table, not ruled out. There isn’t an answer,” said Cornwell. </p> <p>That may depend on the reaction of viewers, in Britain, and around the world.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4gj8j","wordcount":"775","thumbnail":"http://media.guim.co.uk/c75a435506d455cde894929ed0d7c49685829a5d/914_371_2651_1590/140.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2016-02-15T08:00:13Z","standfirst":"<p>The Night Manager, starring Olivia Colman, Tom Hiddleston and Hugh Laurie, is a co-production with company behind Breaking Bad and Mad Men</p>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/feb/12/bbcs-20m-spy-thriller-le-carre-adaptation","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2016/feb/12/bbcs-20m-spy-thriller-le-carre-adaptation","sectionName":"Television & radio","elements":[{"id":"c75a435506d455cde894929ed0d7c49685829a5d","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://media.guim.co.uk/c75a435506d455cde894929ed0d7c49685829a5d/914_371_2651_1590/140.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"WARNING: Use of this copyright image is subject to the terms of use of BBC Pictures' Digital Picture Service (BBC Pictures) as set out at www.bbcpictures.co.uk.

Capote’s In Cold Blood. Andrew Hankinson attempts to get inside Moat’s mind","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>The Northumbria Police won’t ever forget <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/raoul-moat\">Raoul Moat</a>. The week of July 2010 when Moat went on the rampage was unprecedented. Moat, a 37-year-old Geordie bodybuilder, was serving a short sentence for assault in Durham prison when his 22-year-old girlfriend Sam dumped him for a younger man. Two days after his release, Moat shot and killed the new boyfriend with a sawn-off shotgun, then turned it on Sam, hospitalising her. He declared war on the Northumbria police and blinded one of their officers, who was sitting unarmed in his car. On the run for seven days, Moat camped out in the woods of Northumberland. TV tracker <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/sep/04/ray-mears-it-found-me-great-outdoors\">Ray Mears</a> was called in. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jul/09/paul-gascoigne-raoul-moat\">Paul Gascoigne</a> turned up during the police stand-off. Surrounded by armed police, Moat shot and killed himself.</p> <p>The mother of the first victim, Chris Brown, complained at the time that Moat received far more publicity than her own son. An RIP Moat fan club was started up on Facebook. PC David Rathband, unable to cope with sudden blindness, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/08/blinded-police-office-david-rathband-killed-himself\">killed himself</a>. Now Andrew Hankinson, a journalist from Newcastle, has constructed a narrative from Moat’s own written and recorded source material. Why devote a book to him?</p> <p>His purpose is to show Moat as a product of our culture and society. The author takes us inside the killer’s head without giving the reader the privilege of distance in which to judge and dismiss him. The result is an uncomfortable, claustrophobic read. Hankinson follows the techniques of New Journalism that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/truman-capote\">Truman Capote</a> pioneered in the 1960s, where the levers and tools of fiction were used to make true crime more immersive. He deploys the urgent present tense and the second person. “They release you from prison at 10.55am.” This gives the narrative the feel of an unfolding video game. It also has the familiarity of advertising copy, the “you” of opportunity, which is compounded by the ironic title and cover in the style of a 50s advert.</p> <p>As we spend 224 pages inside Moat’s head, we look for clues as to what made him snap. What were his influences? What drove him? One of the book’s themes is the bankrupt, outdated ideology of hard-man masculinity. Moat had worried that dating a 16-year-old when he was 31 would end with him getting hurt, but cannot accept being dumped by Sam six years later. Sam goads him that her new man is “younger and harder” than him, that he will knock him on his arse. For a man like Moat, this is the ultimate disrespect; it cannot go unchallenged. His mate Karl Ness, another bodybuilder, finds him a shotgun and helps him put things right. After the shootings Moat feels better than he has in ages. Out in the woods, with friends, he barbeques sausages as if on an awayday.</p> <p>The book suggests that taunts at men’s masculinity prompt much violence in deprived inner city areas. “Respect” is behind the current spike of shootings in Salford as well as youth knife-crime in London and Glasgow. Moat had a history of violence and anger: a ripped cage-fighter who prayed to God to make him big so he wouldn’t be bullied for being skinny and ginger with grandpa glasses. In HMP Durham he was like a wounded tiger pacing its enclosure.</p> <p>Moat is presented as an intriguing case study in disintegration, making bad choices then devoting all his intelligence to justifying them in his own head. He is obsessed with presenting his own version of events and prolific in his self-presentation: the evidence includes a 49-page confession, audio recordings made on the run, diaries and lengthy recordings of his 999 calls made after the shootings.</p> <p>To avoid Moat’s defence being one-sided, Hankinson provides short barristerial challenges in parentheses. The effect is to steadily undermine the killer’s testimony and reveal him as an unreliable narrator. When Moat dismisses his fights with Sam as “a bit of pushing and shoving”, Hankinson lists a shocking history of domestic violence. (He was equally violent with his previous partner, the mother of his two eldest children.) But Moat cannot take responsibility for Sam leaving him.</p> <p>Hankinson’s reliance on Moat’s own source material is problematic, however, due to the subject’s enormous capacity for self-pity. At times you feel you are on a train journey, trapped listening to him blaming everyone but himself. The council, the police, the system are all out to get him. Even when he makes £10,000 on eBay, he whines about one particular deal for a dodgy £150 trailer. He prides himself on being a “grafter” but is never at home for his kids or family. He becomes so paranoid he takes to recording everything on tape. He dismisses the guilty verdict of a jury and appeals to a higher power:<strong> </strong>he writes to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/jeremykyle\">Jeremy Kyle</a>, offering to take the lie detector on his TV show.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/31/inside-mind-raoul-moat-book-you-could-do-something-amazing-life-andrew-hankinson\">Inside the mind of Raoul Moat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hankinson shows how men together can catalyse their own demise. Moat’s friends never question his disastrous choices: Ness sources the shotgun and drives him around. Another mate, known as Sean, stays up late chatting about how good it feels to shoot a cop, planning how to shoot a social worker. Their daft cover story is to pretend to be his hostages. These two close friends and conspirators end up sentenced to 40 and 20 years respectively.</p> <p>There was an absence of strong male role models in Moat’s past. His biological father left Raoul’s mother during pregnancy and moved to Croydon; he never tried to contact his son. Moat’s stepfather prefers his half-brother Angus. He was brought up by his gran who left Moat’s grandfather, a champion boxer in the army, because he was dangerous. She thought he was trying to push her off a cliff. Moat is the third generation of irresponsible, volatile men: 63% of violent fathers have sons who commit violent crimes.</p> <p>Moat at one point sought help about his mental health, and was referred, but did not show up for the appointment. In Durham prison he was not the only man failing to cope – during his time inside, there were 46 incidents of self-harm and one suicide.</p> <p>As it turns out, the only male figure who speaks to Moat with any sense, asking him to think about the future, about his kids, and to talk to him with empathy and understanding, is the trained police negotiator. This is the last conversation he has, and it’s too late.</p> <p>•<a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/274132/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">You Could Do Something Amazing with Your Life (You are Raoul Moat)</a> by Andrew Hankinson (Scribe Publications, £12.99).

the power to unnerve and astonish nearly 60 years after it was first published","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"UK","body":"<p>Considered the first great New Zealand novel and a modernist masterpiece, <em>Owls Do Cry</em>, first published in 1957, tells of the Withers siblings, Daphne, Chicks, Toby and Francie, and their struggles with financial instability, mental health, disability and grief. The sections on Daphne’s mental illness, informed as they are by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/jan/30/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries\" title=\"\">Janet Frame</a>’s own experiences in institutions, are especially powerful. Descriptions of events in Daphne’s life begin grounded in reality, but slip into grand, dreamlike imagery (“a woman led Daphne to the bathroom where a trough had been scooped from a side of one of the mountains”), vividly conveying her struggle for sanity. Lack of understanding of epilepsy at the time is touched on: Toby “falls into fits”, scaring and embarrassing his sisters.

autobiography, Born to Run will be released internationally on 27 September – a few days after his 67th birthday.</p> <p>According to publishers Simon &amp; Schuster, Springsteen has been privately writing the autobiography for seven years, beginning work in 2009 after his performance with the E Street Band at the Super Bowl’s halftime show. </p> <p>Springsteen describes growing up in Freehold, New Jersey and according to the publisher recounts “his relentless drive to become a musician, his early days as a bar band king in Asbury Park, and the rise of the E Street Band”.</p> <p>“Writing about yourself is a funny business,” Springsteen writes. “But in a project like this, the writer has made one promise, to show the reader his mind. In these pages, I’ve tried to do this.”</p> <p>A spokesman for the publisher called it “the book we’ve been hoping for. Readers will see their own lives in Bruce Springsteen’s extraordinary story, just as we recognise ourselves in his songs.”</p> <p>Simon &amp; Schuster, which will publish Born to Run in the US, UK, Canada, Australia and India also published Springsteen’s illustrated book <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlaw_Pete\">Outlaw Pete</a> in 2014.</p> <p>“If you were to ask any publisher to name a cultural figure whose autobiography would provoke the greatest enthusiasm, Bruce Springsteen’s name would be on every list,” said Ian Chapman, CEO of Simon &amp; Schuster UK. “Beyond being one of the most admired individuals in the world, he is a captivating storyteller with a unique way of expressing himself.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p>

Here are works that could be read from start to finish in that time","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>How exactly a one-sitting novella is defined depends upon an individual’s reading speed. Broad definitions have the novella as a work of anything between 15,000 and 40,000 words. In fact, many of the most widely read (and taught) literary works qualify as one-sitting reads. A Christmas Carol, Call Of The Wild, Heart Of Darkness, The Great Gatsby, Of Mice and Men, Animal Farm, A Clockwork Orange – all could be technically considered novellas. Other key works – Melville’s Bartleby, the Scrivener, for example – are deemed short stories.</p> <p><strong>Notes From Underground by Fyodor Dostoevsky (1864)</strong></p> <p>A work of two distinct halves, Dostoevsky’s novella concerns human suffering, as expressed first through the diaries of an alienated narrator and then via a series of his jarring encounters. Pain and poverty also play a part in what is often considered the birth of existentialist fiction. It ends with the memorable line “it seems that we may stop here.”</p> <p><strong>Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka (1915)</strong></p> <p>All the tropes of Kafka’s work are explored when salesman Gregor Samsa awakes to find he has turned into an <em>ungeheures Ungeziefer</em> – a “monstrous vermin”, beetle or bug. And so begin his satirical and moving attempts to survive the burdens of an absurd situation in an increasingly absurd world.</p> <p><strong>Giovanni’s Room by James Baldwin (1956)</strong></p> <p>Adrift in Paris while his girlfriend returns to America to consider his marriage proposal, David falls in love with the charismatic bartender Giovanni. Sexuality, love, manhood, monogamy and betrayal are swiftly brought into question. The themes reflect Baldwin’s own exile in Paris – though his publisher first suggested he burn the manuscript of this tender and economical work.</p> <p><strong>The Driver’s Seat by Muriel Spark (1970)</strong></p> <p>Fleeing her dull job in a Northern European country, Lise heads south on holiday where she reinvents herself as temptress on a quest for sex and adventure. But when a history of erratic behaviour and a death become apparent, Spark reveals The Driver’s Seat to be what she called a “whydunnit”.</p> <p><strong>A Month In The Country by JL Carr (1980)</strong></p> <p>Tom Birkin’s employment restoring a Medieval mural in a Yorkshire village during the summer of 1920 initially suggests a pastoral and wistful work. Yet like local archaeologist Moon, he is a survivor of the recent battle of Passchendaele in the first world war, and the shadow of conflict looms large over this melancholic and utterly moving work.</p> <p><strong>Fup by Jim Dodge (1983)</strong></p> <p>Belligerent 99-year-old whisky-swilling Jake Santee and his adopted gentle giant of a son Tiny are joined by mallard duck Fup, whose rambunctious personality is matched only by his expanding appetite. With shades of Mark Twain and A Confederacy Of Dunces, Dodge delivered a debut novella that looks set to stay the distance.</p> <p><strong>Sukkwan Island by David Vann (2008)</strong></p> <p>The central piece in Vann’s Legend Of A Suicide collection sees young Roy accompany his failed and suicidal father on an ill-advised sojourn into the Alaskan wilderness. Hanging on an unexpected plot development, it’s a gruelling, oppressive, gripping and disturbing piece of writing whose power and intensity are heightened when read unbroken.</p> <p><strong>Train Dreams by Denis Johnson (2012)</strong></p> <p>A humble labourer in the American West during the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, Robert Grainier’s life and losses – of innocence, of family – can be read as both an allegorical history of contemporary America or simply the struggle of one man trying to make sense of human existence. Either way, Train Dreams confirmed Denis Johnson as one of the greatest living writers.</p> <p><strong>The Fifty Year Sword by Mark Z Danielewski (2012)</strong></p> <p>Less a piece of prose and more a tapestry of words – or a detonated poem perhaps – this takes the traditional fireside ghost story and inverts it. At a birthday party in East Texas five orphans are entertained by the tale of a sword with a blade that’s capable of inflicting wounds only visible when the victim turns 50.</p> <p><strong>The Dig by Cynan Jones (2014)</strong></p> <p>A dark, unnerving and compact work about a sadistic badger-baiter and a bereaved farmer set in rural Wales, The Dig epitomises the power and economy of the novella at its masterful best. Jones’s stripped-down language echoes the repressed emotions of men in turmoil against a backdrop of darkening copses and sodden fields.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/455m8","wordcount":"708","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/22/1421964637365/60e42506-b12a-4767-abf5-d461476e02bf-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-26T16:08:47Z","standfirst":"<p>National Readathon Day, which aims to promote literacy, takes places across the US on Saturday from midday to 4pm.

The export to an undisclosed overseas buyer will be delayed until April to give a UK institution a chance to match the auction price of almost £250,000 – five times the original estimate.</p> <p>The manuscript, believed by scholars to be made by Tyndale, is in the elegant writing of a professional scribe and was made in 1523, probably for presentation to Tyndale’s early patrons. It is the earliest translation into English of any Erasmus work. Later English versions of the Erasmus, Enchiridion militis Christiani (The Handbook of a Christian Knight) – a humanist guide to lay devotion which was an admired and influential work across Europe – were believed based on a Tyndale translation but the original was thought to be lost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fecdb1d1-952a-49a1-8fb9-4485818dfe9e\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421249035641/1bb74471-3fcd-47a0-a6b1-27aeb7fe6a94-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"manuscript of William Tyndale's translation of a work by Erasmus\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Part of a page from the manuscript of William Tyndale’s translation of a work by Erasmus - The Handbook of a Christian Knight (1523).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sotheby's</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1523 Tyndale, whose Bible translation later influenced the authorised King James version, had graduated from Oxford and was working as a tutor in an aristocratic household back in his native Gloucestershire. He was already championing the philosophy of Erasmus and other reformers, and getting into disputes over scripture.</p> <p>According to John Foxe’s Book of Martyrs, he translated the Erasmus essay to justify his beliefs to his employers. The manuscript is believed to be the presentation copy he had made of that translation, the only surviving contemporary manuscript of any literary work by Tyndale.</p> <p>The 145-page manuscript had been in Alnwick since at least 1872, disguised in a much later red Morocco leather binding, and its significance was only spotted when it was included in a large sale from the Duke of Northumberland’s ancestral collection at Sotheby’s last summer.</p> <p>Christopher Wright, a member of the committee that advises the government on the export of important works of art, said: “This newly discovered translation of one of Erasmus’s most popular works would be of great interest in its own right. The tantalising possibility that it is the hitherto lost translation by William Tyndale confers on it international importance.”</p> <p>Culture minister Ed Vaizey described it as a rare and important work and said he sincerely hoped the money could be raised to keep it in Britain.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44pzh","wordcount":"461","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421248462334/Erasmus-1467-1536--004.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-17T15:30:08Z","standfirst":"Translation made in 1523 of humanist scholar by man who created English version of the Bible sold at auction for £250,000 after discovery in Alnwick Castle"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jan/14/uk-freezes-export-unique-erasmus-manuscript-william-tyndale","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2015/jan/14/uk-freezes-export-unique-erasmus-manuscript-william-tyndale","sectionName":"Culture","elements":[{"id":"3aa08e122325d5d1435e1f7d7c61aeebc02a7f65","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/1/14/1421248467851/Erasmus-1467-1536--009.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Corbis","picdarUrn":"GD*1183023","suppliersReference":"10125572","altText":"Erasmus (1467-1536) ","caption":"The humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus (1467-1536).

Two men in white flannels, one a film-maker, are looking back to last year’s fiesta. It was then, we discover, that Geoffrey Firmin – the former British consul, ex-husband of Yvonne, a rampant alcoholic and also a ruined man – embarked on his <em>via crucis</em>, an agonised passage through a fateful day, that would end in Firmin’s killing.</p> <p>Lowry himself, a refugee from the Fitzrovia of his contemporary George Orwell and the young Dylan Thomas, described <em>Under the Volcano </em>as “a prophecy, a political warning, a cryptogram, a preposterous movie, and a writing on the wall”. At the back of his mind, he was inspired by Melville (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/13/100-best-novels-observer-moby-dick\" title=\"\">No 17 in this series</a>) and the capacious majesty of <em>Moby-Dick</em>. Lowry’s Captain Ahab, however, is fighting a more nebulous nemesis than a whale. In 12 chapters corresponding to the 12 hours of the consul’s last day on earth, Lowry takes Firmin on a colossal bender, fuelled by beer, wine, tequila and mescal (“strychnine” to our protagonist). He is drinking himself to death, like Lowry himself, though<em> Under the Volcano </em>is about much more than alcoholism. Halfway through, the consul decides that “It was already the longest day in his entire experience, a lifetime”. Formally, then, the novel’s narrative technique owes a huge debt to Joyce, Conrad, and Faulkner (Nos <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/04/100-best-novels-ulysses-james-joyce-robert-mccrum\" title=\"\">46</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/28/100-best-novels-heart-of-darkness-joseph-conrad\" title=\"\">32</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/06/100-best-novels-as-i-lay-dying-william-faulkner\" title=\"\">55</a> in this series). Lowry’s text also teems with allusions to classical and Jacobean tragedy, echoing the cadences of Christopher Marlowe and the Elizabethans.</p> <p>One of mescal’s side-effects is a highly lucid, almost brilliant, depression: this is a dominant mood throughout much of Lowry’s introverted, strangely compulsive narrative. Again and again, he insists that he is present in all his characters, an assertion of complex consciousness that is also a deranged kind of solipsism provoked by tropical drink and drugs. We are in the Mexico that attracted many interwar English literary travellers, notably Lawrence, Waugh and Greene, but it’s a Mexico that has become a hell on earth.</p> <p>The background to the consul’s Day of the Dead is the drumbeat of conflict, both public and private. Germany is re-arming. Yvonne, Fimin’s divorced wife, has come back to challenge his drinking. “Must you go on and on forever into this stupid darkness?” she asks. At the edge of darkness there is death.<em> Under the Volcano </em>began in Lowry’s mind when, arriving in Mexico, he saw a local Indian bleeding to death by the roadside, which is how Firmin will end, shot in a cheap bar before being tossed into a ravine with a dead dog. The last moments of the consul at the end of the “Day of the Dead” (chapter 12) become one of the greatest passages of English prose on the eve of the second world war.</p> <h2>A note on the text</h2> <p>No writer in this series had as much trouble as Malcolm Lowry, from inside and out, with his work-in-progress. For the struggling author, in the making of his masterpiece, over nearly a decade, almost nothing went right. At first, in 1936, living in Cuernavaca, Mexico, in the shadow of two volcanoes (Popocatépetl and Iztaccihuatl), galloping alcoholism and a failing marriage, Lowry wrote a short story (not finally published until the 1960s) entitled “Under the Volcano”, a sketch of the bigger canvas that was to follow, including a horse branded with the number seven.</p> <p>The first, raw draft of <em>Under the Volcano</em> followed soon after. He considered this to be the “Inferno” element of a trilogy, <em>The Voyage that Never Ends</em>, modelled on Dante’s <em>Divine Comedy</em>. Ultimately, fate determined that only the first part of this ambitious project would ever be completed to its author’s satisfaction. In 1940, Lowry commissioned a New York literary agent, Harold Matson, to find a publisher for this manuscript, which was roundly rejected, up and down Manhattan.</p> <p>Next, between 1940 and 1944, Lowry revised the novel, with crucial editorial assistance from the actress Margerie Bonner, who saved him from the worst of his alcoholism and later became his second wife. This process absorbed him completely: during those years Lowry, who had previously preferred to address himself to several projects at the same time, worked on nothing but his manuscript. In 1944, the current draft was nearly lost in a fire at Lowry’s beach house (a squatter’s shack) in British Columbia. Bonner rescued the unfinished novel, but the rest of Lowry’s works in progress were consumed in the blaze.</p> <p>The novel was finished in 1945 and immediately submitted to a number of publishers. In late winter, while still travelling abroad, Lowry heard that his novel had been accepted by Reynal &amp; Hitchcock in the United States and Jonathan Cape in Britain. Cape had reservations about publishing and asked for drastic revisions. He added that if Lowry didn’t make the changes “it does not necessarily mean I would say no”. Lowry’s reply, written in January 1946, was a prolonged, vehement, slightly mad defence of the book as something to be considered a work of lasting greatness: “It can be regarded as a kind of symphony,” he wrote, “or in another way as a kind of opera – or even a horse opera. It is hot music, a poem, a song, a tragedy, a comedy, a farce and so forth … Whether it sells or not seems to me either way a risk. But there is something about the destiny of the creation of the book that seems to tell me it just might go on selling a very long time.”</p> <p>Cape published the novel without further revision. To Anthony Burgess it was “a Faustian masterpiece”. Yet, <em>Under the Volcano</em> was remaindered in England, and out of print when Lowry died of alcoholism in 1957. Thanks to a better response in North America, especially Canada, its afterlife has been lusty and international, featuring regularly on several “best novels” lists. Now it’s recognised as a classic.</p> <h2>Three More From Malcolm Lowry</h2> <p><em>Ultramarine</em> (1933); <em>Lunar Caustic </em>(1968);<em> October Ferry to Gabriola </em>(1970).</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/44ev3","wordcount":"1006","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/23/1419349126808/Malcolm-Lowry-the-draft-o-005.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-01-23T00:29:00+00:00","standfirst":"Malcolm Lowry’s masterpiece about the last hours of an alcoholic ex-diplomat in Mexico is set to the drumbeat of coming conflict"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/05/100-best-novels-observer-malcolm-lowry-under-the-volcano","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2015/jan/05/100-best-novels-observer-malcolm-lowry-under-the-volcano","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"f8d3d3349199d825ee1027c86804f649ada2f4db","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/23/1419349133826/Malcolm-Lowry-the-draft-o-010.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Rex Features","picdarUrn":"GD*48984635","suppliersReference":"132367a","altText":"Malcolm Lowry: the draft of Under the Volcano was nearly lost in a fire at his shack in British Colu","caption":"Malcolm Lowry: the draft of Under the Volcano was nearly lost in a fire at his shack in British Columbia.

While I’m here!” announced Baroness James of Holland Park on arrival at the College of the Resurrection in Mirfield, West Yorkshire, where I was studying for ordination. Better known as PD James, she had come to research life in such places for her murder mystery <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/04/crime.pdjames1\" title=\"\"><em>Death in Holy Orders</em></a>. A clever choice, for life in religious communities is exacting and unsparing and as the Superior at the monastery we were attached to once said, “If there was a murder here there would be 50 suspects at least.”</p> <p>Lifting the lid on the darker aspects of life therein can be risky – I have done the same in <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/fathomless-riches.html\" title=\"\">my own memoir</a> published this year – so her presence, while exciting, was also a little discomfiting and we were on our best behaviour. So was she, unfailingly, but while <em>toujours la politesse </em>prevailed I could tell simply from the way she looked at people that she was alert for the gaps between theory and practice, between what was said and what was done; a characteristic one might expect to find in a crime writer.</p> <p>It was my job to be her chaperone, to show her round again, to sit beside her at the principal’s table in the refectory, to be her walker at impromptu sherry parties, to deliver her to services in church, often a minefield for the uninitiated, monastic liturgies having none of the pointers to standing up and sitting down and finding your place that many seem to like. She was unfazed by these, quite content to sit and listen and pray while we got on with the chanting of the psalms and the offering of the prayers. She understood, as someone familiar with high church ways, that this division of labour was not intended to exclude but to diversify. Besides, she was there as an observer, to capture the detail and atmosphere of such places, and in the interests of research had also visited another high church college at Oxford, our great rival, so we read the book and watched the television adaptation with slightly competitive interest.</p> <p>In the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/arts/critic/feature/0,,1160447,00.html\" title=\"\"> television version</a> we all gave a sharp intake of breath when we saw the ordinands at her fictional college wearing white instead of black scapulars to serve in the refectory – that’s us, we exclaimed – but she also captured the febrile atmosphere not only of our college but of our rival too, vibrant with gossip and tense with <em>odium theologicum</em>, the professional hatreds peculiar to our calling, which so unmake the common life that we are obliged to try to live. I wondered how aggressive a combatant she might have been in those had she been a participant rather than a spectator, for she was a true conservative as well as a Conservative. But she was Phyllis, not Baroness James, on that occasion, and it is as Phyllis I will remember her; curious, courteous, perspicacious.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/448tj","wordcount":"515","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418746852396/PD-James-006.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2014-01-10T15:39:00+00:00","standfirst":"<p><strong>3 August 1920–27 November 2014</strong><br>The crime writer was courteous and perspicacious – and alert for the gaps between what was said and what was done</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/series/obituaries-of-2014\">See the Observer’s obituaries of 2014 in full</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"http://gu.com/p/449bq\">Stephen Sutton remembered by his mother</a></li></ul>"},"webUrl":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/21/pd-james-remembered-richard-coles-observer-obituaries-2014-death-in-holy-orders","apiUrl":"http://content.guardianapis.com/books/2014/dec/21/pd-james-remembered-richard-coles-observer-obituaries-2014-death-in-holy-orders","sectionName":"Books","elements":[{"id":"d8786082e6455a4be29c7ab30ecb92c6729d051b","relation":"main","type":"image","assets":[{"type":"image","file":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/16/1418746859178/PD-James-011.jpg","typeData":{"copyright":"Linda Nylind","picdarUrn":"GD*19700860","altText":"PD James","caption":"‘Call me Phyllis!’: crime writer PD James, photographed at home in London,2011.

Dean","headline":"What to read over Thanksgiving","trailText":"It’s the time of year when you might want to disappear into a book – and especially one about families even more dysfunctional than your own","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>Thanksgiving is a holiday of hidden meanings. It pretends to be about mutual respect, specifically that between the settlers and the indigenous people of North America. But of course you can only sincerely celebrate that if you ignore the way the former subsequently killed off large swaths of the latter. Similarly, the sweet experience of family togetherness promised by the holiday is a lie, for most people. Get stuck in a room with your family and, well, even family love is a battlefield.</p> <p>I have, therefore, books to recommend both as psychic preparation and coping mechanism for the holiday. These books are mostly about families, unconventional ones. To read them is to feel the satisfying superiority of one who knows that things could always be worse.</p> <p>You might, for example, belong to the kind of family where money and finances are a recurring theme in holiday arguments. If so, trundle over to your old schoolbooks and pick up<strong> Thomas Hardy’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/07/100-best-novels-jude-obscure-thomas-hardy\">Jude the Obscure</a></strong> again. This one is even suitable for reading aloud in the midst of arguments. Jude Fawley’s inability to support his offspring, and the consequent misery he inflicts on Sue, forms a useful shield for the modern financially-precarious child. The mere contrast between Jude and Sue’s situation and your own should convince parents that low contributions to a <a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/401%28k%29-Plans\">401(k) plan</a> are not tantamount to catastrophe. And, should there be a surprise on the way, you can point out that we no longer live in the 19th century where children out of wedlock will make you a social pariah. (Arabella really was kind of right when she told Sue to marry Jude because “[l]ife with a man is more businesslike after it.”)</p> <p>Family arguments about money may give rise to certain fantasies of how unlimited resources could allow you to live in harmony. Nonfiction is best at divesting yourself of this lie.<strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/may/25/biography.film\">Mommie Dearest</a> by Christina Crawford</strong>, is a swift corrective to that end. Joan Crawford only let her wear <em>two</em> of all the pretty dresses she bought! But a copy of Crawford’s bestselling classic can now be hard to come by. So I’d pair this with a perusal of <strong>Bill Dedman and Paul Clark Newell Jr’s recent <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Empty-Mansions-Mysterious-Huguette-Spending/dp/0345534530\">Empty Mansions: The Mysterious Life of Huguette Clark and the Spending of a Great American Fortune</a></strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Empty-Mansions-Mysterious-Huguette-Spending/dp/0345534530\">.</a> Clark’s story just goes to show you that the promise of a huge inheritance will not keep you from dying alone. Moreover, owning several mansions while doing it will just make you suspicious that everyone wants your money, which let’s face it, they probably do.</p> <p>Some people’s families come closer to the edge of outright violence. Good news: there is a wealth of good literature which will remind you how sane and normal you are even if voices get raised. Consider <strong>Shirley Jackson’s<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/apr/18/shirley-jackson-back-garlic-in-fiction\"> We Have Always Lived in the Castle</a></strong>. The family at issue numbers only three, the survivors of a family arsenic poisoning. Their story is narrated by Merricat, the younger of two surviving sisters. Constance, the elder, is widely rumored to have put the arsenic in the family sugar bowl. There is regular allusion to a table which their Uncle Julian admits “is overlarge now for the pitiful remnant of our family.” By the time you learn exactly what happened with the arsenic you will be intrigued by the intrafamilial dynamic here but also grateful that your own is more straightforward.</p> <p>If you prefer nonfiction there is also a recent biography of Charles Manson to peruse. Of course, he wasn’t a <em>conventional</em> patriarch. But <strong>Jeff Guinn’s <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Manson-Life-Times-Charles/dp/1451645171/\">Manson: The Life and Times of Charles Manson</a></strong> will at least shatter your illusion that most people, given the option, would choose a better family for themselves than the one they are born in. No quirks of your family will seem quite as irritating when laid side by side with the Mansons’. Even setting aside the gruesome murder thing, Guinn details sobering family rules like Manson’s firm prohibition of the use of eye-glasses. Although it can always be hard to perceive things clearly in family settings, there is something dreadfully direct about such a rule against <em>seeing</em>.</p> <p>And if all these families are not catastrophic enough with you, if you still need further levels of interior and exterior violence to get a handle on your own situation, there is always <strong>Lionel Shriver’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/27/fiction.features\">We Need to Talk About Kevin</a></strong><em>.</em> The mother-of-a-school-shooter tale is a kind of early-aughts bogeyman. But Shriver’s made it all the more upsetting by portraying the process of raising such a kid as a tug-of war between reluctant mother and off-kilter son. The book is unrelentingly bleak, copping to misery early on: “one of our first sacrifices to family life was lightness of heart.” Every bit of family fun in that book is portrayed as self-delusion even <em>before</em> the tragedy. Which, if nothing else, will leave you grateful for every small, sincere laugh you might have while stuck with your own family over the holiday.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43jan","wordcount":"830","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/26/1416961596894/6349e9af-29e7-4876-a526-c0efead30d94-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2014-12-03T13:00:05Z","standfirst":"<p>It’s

When I started – as a temporary typist – I knew very little about him. He drank gallons of tea. He had renounced a peerage. He had opposed the Falklands war. He had defended the miners and the Wapping printers. In those days Tony resembled a restless caged animal, pent up in his basement office. The man who nearly became prime minister had gone from hero to almost zero; he had undergone a sustained mauling by press and broadcasting, which took its toll on his health and his personal life.</p> <p>He had kept diaries on and off since he was a boy, and it was the publication of the diaries, the first of nine volumes in 1987, that gave him a new lease of life and turned his office into a hive of activity, with young “interns” from school or university (including Ed Miliband) queueing up to work for him.</p> <p>Edward (as we knew him) was very sweet – modest, clever and quick. I took him, and the other interns, under my wing as I set them to work indexing Tony’s extensive archive of paper, audio and video records. My role morphed into editing the handwritten and transcribed diaries: Tony marking up one copy and me a second, then resolving our differences. Only once or twice in the ensuing years did I flounce out of the office.</p> <p>Tony’s public persona when I first knew him was, perhaps not surprisingly given the history of the Labour party in the 1980s, rather puritanical and humourless; but privately he was very mischievous, and often childlike in his sense of fun. As a boy he was not allowed pets, and when I heard this, I gave him a clockwork ginger kitten, which would walk a few steps, then sit down and miaow pitifully before taking a few more steps. He loved this toy and would entertain passengers on trains or staff at the House of Commons by letting the kitten loose, to gales of laughter. The combination of political bogeyman and innocent joker was irresistible. In 1990, he decided it was time that Emily Wilding Davison was celebrated in the Commons, and he and fellow Labour leftwinger Jeremy Corbyn went into the broom cupboard in which she had hidden during the campaign for women’s votes, and screwed a brass plaque to the inside of the door, much to the disapproval of Black Rod and the Serjeant at Arms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2675db61afaadc61be54d3159779bbc33c95a663\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/25/1416933803348/fcfa2ac9-027c-4134-b7ba-61a30db3d8b7-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Benn\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Benn speaking in 1983 in St James’s Church, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Wood/Daily Mail /Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tony wrote in his diary when he was 70: “I’d like to throw a light on the future, the next century … but I’m a bit nervous that I would not have the intellectual capacity to produce anything good. That’s why I tend to stay in the old grooves.” In compiling an anthology of his best speeches, interviews and articles, I rediscovered the power and originality of his earlier work. He wrote for the Guardian during the early 1960s (when he was out of the Commons, fighting to disinherit his peerage), and produced some excoriating journalism, including the condemnation of “the shoddy acts of state that pass for a policy” in South Africa; and a description of the hanging of Russell Pascoe in Horfield prison in December 1963 while “the centre of Bristol was ablaze with twinkling lights and full of shoppers carrying their parcels”. It would have convinced any doubters of the wickedness of capital punishment.</p> <p>In fact, despite his fear of being “stuck in the old grooves” the last 10 years of Tony’s life produced a fresh bout of creative thinking; he argued the case for the legalisation of drugs; for the House of Commons to become an English parliament with the House of Lords acting as the UK federal chamber; and for an end to drugs testing on animals. <a href=\"http://blog.peta.org.uk/2014/03/tony-benn-will-be-missed/\" title=\"\">He was an ardent vegetarian</a>. He was also the world’s greatest junk-food fan. Burgers and milkshakes were his staple diet until he gave up meat, and then he turned to pizza and ice-cream for the rest of his life.</p> <p>His children and his carers would stock the fridge with tempting gourmet meals to no avail.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2f6d0811880434b875002536f772b2a132853ce\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/25/1416927653187/981aaf55-3720-418c-9987-2cb354f66cee-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Benn: Will and Testament\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from the set of Tony Benn: Will &amp; Testament</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the time I worked for Tony, he was the Labour MP for Chesterfield – a mining town that had offered him a political rebirth in 1984, and had been devastated by the miners’ strike of 1984-5. I have dwelt on his idiosyncrasies and mischievousness because that is what I most liked and remember about Tony, but when he sat every Friday in his constituency office at the Labour Club in Chesterfield I witnessed at first hand a professional at his most brilliant. For a few weeks I filmed on a hand-held video camera the cases that he – as many other conscientious MPs – had to deal with in the course of a surgery. Tony would occupy the upper room of the club, while a queue of constituents would wait in the hall outside. Among them on one particular Friday, there was a young man with a plastic bag full of documents of Kafkaesque complexity; a woman, accompanied by an older man (her father? uncle? husband? boyfriend? – it wasn’t clear) with a bogus story of being robbed and destitute; a retired couple who wanted to move because their life was being ruined by youngsters who trashed their front garden. Tony would cut to the heart of a long and often convoluted tale, like a hot knife through butter, to deal with the constituent’s problem – or help him or her to realise that <em>they</em> were the problem. I never saw him intimidated, bored or angry during these Friday sessions. He retired in 2001, free from constituency and parliamentary considerations, leaving a priceless social archive.</p> <p>In 2010 I was contacted by a young film director, Skip Kite. Like Tony, he was an avid pipe smoker and that was perhaps why I was persuaded (where other filmmakers had failed) to arrange a meeting between them a few days later. Skip brought with him to Tony’s house a book of John Betjeman poems, which he read while they puffed their pipes and Tony nodded off, having had a stroke from which he was still recovering.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2014/jun/20/tony-benn-will-and-testament-politics-trailer-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/3qa3v\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2113452\"            data-video-name=\"Tony Benn: Will and Testament - watch the exclusive trailer for the left-wing icon's account of his life - video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/6/20/1403258298975/Labour-politician-Tony-Be-025.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-439988221\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/6/20/1403258296250/Labour-politician-Tony-Be-023.jpg\"> <source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn-16x9.mp4\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn/140620TonyBenn.m3u8\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn.webm\"></source><source src=\"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2014/06/20/140620TonyBenn_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"></source> </video> <figcaption>Watch the trailer for Tony Benn: Will and Testament</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The three years that it took for Skip to make the resulting film – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/02/tony-benn-will-and-testament-review\" title=\"\">Tony Benn: Will and Testament </a>– were dominated by Tony’s ill health, but the project revitalised him. When he was later taken to the Chelsea and Westminster hospital after another collapse, I received a stern email from his consultant, Michael Pelly. “The patient has disappeared from the ward with his friend. He has missed a physiotherapy appointment.” Skip had helped Tony “escape” to a coffee shop next door, where they were found at a table on the pavement, smoking and surrounded by students.

impending doom, writes <strong>Ann Friedman</strong>","hasStoryPackage":"false","productionOffice":"US","body":"<p>Riding in cars with boys is high on the list of stereotypical teenage bad-girl behavior. But riding in cars with other girls can be far worse. A car with two teenage girls is an enclosed space, hurtling fast to nowhere in particular, where insecurities bloom and fade based on constant comparisons to the girl in the next seat over. </p> <p>This is where <a href=\"http://lindsayhunter.tumblr.com/\">Lindsay Hunter</a>’s debut novel, Ugly Girls, begins: in a car with Perry and Baby Girl, two bored high-schoolers whose families have little and who have even less themselves. They are not really best friends in the sense that they tell each other everything or turn to each other for help. They are best friends in the sense that they have a lot of time to kill before graduation, and for some reason they mostly spend it together.<br /></p> <p>Perry is a mean, pretty, blonde daughter of an alcoholic fading beauty and a good-hearted prison guard. Baby Girl is a chubby, half-bald, self-styled thug who lives with her uncle and her older brother, a former bad-boy role model who is now disabled after a motorcycle accident. Their relationship is defined by a pervasive awareness that one of them is attractive to too many men and the other attractive to none. Yet somehow they are the same. “Sometimes it seemed mean thoughts were all Perry had for Baby Girl,” Hunter writes, “but when she caught sight of herself in the side mirror she saw she was doing all the same shit.”</p> <p>Both girls have been chatting and texting with a guy named Jamey, and it soon becomes clear to the reader that he is not the shy high-school boy he told them he is. From the first pages, I’d had an overwhelming feeling that, for these girls, everything won’t turn out OK – and, with this revelation about Jamey, for a second I wondered if I was reading a Gone Girl-style thriller. But the sense of impending doom in Ugly Girls<em> </em>is different. Hunter exposes a weary truth of working-class life: bad things just <em>happen</em> to people who work too many hours for too little money and use booze or sex or violence to cope. And when they think they’re out of the woods – both metaphorical and literal – <em>more</em> bad things happen. There is no emergency fund. There are no strings to pull. There is no reprieve.</p> <p>While Perry and Baby Girl are acutely aware of their financial station in life, in the self-centered manner of all teenagers, their dominant feeling is one of trapped boredom. Teenage boredom crosses class lines, of course, and kids who grow up on leafy cul-de-sacs are just as likely as those who grow up in trailer parks to alleviate that tedium with cheap thrills like shoplifting lipgloss and cutting class. But the “bad girl” phase carries the threat of real consequences for the poor kids and their families, which are already hanging by a thread. </p> <p>If the girls catch themselves longing for more, they don’t dare indulge the fantasy. When Baby Girl can finally admit that she wants to be touched and cared for, she calls herself pathetic – <em>girly – </em>and doubles down on her tough-bitch persona. When Perry feels her world spinning out of control, she imitates the men whose attention she loathes and revels in. And then they turn their gaze outward, appraising each other, each hating the other girl for her flaws and, equally, for her attempts to cover them up. </p> <p>This is not a heartwarming tale about the transcendent power of female friendship. It’s a lesson that sometimes the odds are stacked so high against women that their friendship doesn’t stand a chance. Hunter also exposes a weary truth of womanhood: a girl who is only ugly on the inside is going to come out ahead of even the most virtuous girl who is ugly on the outside. Perry and Baby Girl have internalized this truth, and it’s what makes them both so fatalistic. </p> <p>Even if we don’t like these bad girls, Hunter has written them in such a way that we understand them. We feel for Perry and Baby Girl. And we feel an overwhelming sense of relief that we are not in the car alongside them.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43ad7","wordcount":"710","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/13/1415902260728/7f9e1cb9-2817-4688-93cb-645fbd3d0e78-140x84.jpeg","commentCloseDate":"2014-11-16T14:45:00-05:00","standfirst":"<p>This

Now academic research further challenges the image of eccentric hobbyists scribbling away in their sheds by revealing that it is middle-aged and well-educated women who dominate the growing e-publishing market.</p> <p>Alison Baverstock, an associate professor in publishing at Kingston University, Surrey, said her research showed a clear gender split, with 65% of self-publishers being women and 35% men. Nearly two-thirds of all self-publishers are aged 41 to 60, with a further 27% aged over 61. Half are in full-time employment, 32% have a degree and 44% a higher degree.</p> <p>Baverstock said there was a widespread misunderstanding about who decides to self-publish a book, and how the genre was changing the publishing industry.</p> <p>James has become arguably the richest of self-published authors through her “mummy porn” but, while the prose and storylines have won mass audiences, they have also attracted scorn. There is a belief, according to Baverstock, that self-publishers are doing so as a last resort, as vanity publishers, and may not have much formal education.</p> <p>However, she said, James was an example of how self-publishers “really know their audiences, she is pretty sophisticated … she had self-belief. The books people really want to share are fiction”.</p> <p>Presenting her work to the <a href=\"http://www.westminsterforumprojects.co.uk/forums/index.php?fid=westminster_media_forum\">Westminster Media Forum</a> on the prospects for books, publishing and libraries , Baverstock said there were popular subjects that traditional publishers had ignored, including “respectable soft porn” and “gentle memoirs of everyday disasters, such as losing a child”. Most publishers, she said, were being outpaced by a heady mix of democratisation and digital distribution, because they came from a “very limited gene pool … all agree on what they like … they know each other, and are not necessarily in touch with popular taste. Self-publishing is going on in schools, across institutions, spreading knowledge [of how to publish].”</p> <p>Gordon Wise, senior literary agent at Curtis Brown, lent support to her argument, adding: “Authors may wish to remain self-published; there are many routes to market.”</p> <p>Baverstock said that rapid change also meant “the position of the [literary] agent could be quite threatened. If all an agent does is take a percentage of what the author receives, that sort of relationship is threatened. Lots of people self- publishing are collaborative, they share information.”</p> <p>Nicola Solomon, chief executive of the Society of Authors, said that self-publishing had “come of age”, was making decent returns for some and was not just for people who want to be published at any cost.</p> <p>A quarter of self-publishers already considered themselves to be writers. “Publishers are narrowing around safer options, bigger brand names. Lots of middle list authors, with a steady return, are too small for them to engage with,” Solomon added.</p> <p>Baverstock said that, far from feeling desperation, there was a consistently very high satisfaction with self-publishing. Nor did it necessarily mean going it alone. In current research she is tracking self-publishers’ rising use of freelance editors and marketing and legal experts after discovering in a 2012 survey that 59% had used an editor – removing one of the last distinctions between published and self-published books.</p> <p>The rising demand for freelance editors means the quality is rising. She said that self-publishers had to take personal responsibility for the management and production, so opening up an understanding of how publishing worked. “This will hopefully diversify participation, widen involvement. The author with experience of self-publishing is empowered,” she said.</p> <p>Jeremy Thompson, managing director of Troubadour Publishing, a traditional publisher which has also diversified into Matador, a self-publishing service, said demand had grown so rapidly in the last few years that more commercial publishers were setting up self-publishing arms.</p> <p>Opportunities to buy and sell are diversifying as digital sites such as <a href=\"http://blog.smashwords.com/2014/03/sizing-self-publishing-market-10.html\">Smashwords</a> allow writers to publish their own stories online free of charge. But the Westminster Media Forum heard that people were suspicious of books available for nothing, and there was a sweet spot price point of around £3.99 for an e-book.</p> <p>Michael Tamblyn, president and chief content officer of Canada’s Kobo e-book platform, said that a further challenge to publishers was that e-books, which record people moving on to the next page, were throwing up “monumental data” about how people read.</p> <p>“How people engage with books has been an undiscovered country,” he said. “How many are opened, how many are finished. It enables us to find a book that did not sell well, but every person liked it well enough to finish it. Also, where the reader lost the thread. To any author is that helpful? It brings the reader into the picture.”</p> <p>And some behaviour has not changed. He added: “We are seeing a surprising number of books, award-winning titles purchased with the best of intentions, still sitting on the digital shelf.”</p> <h2>QUEENS OF SELF-PUBLISHING</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f4363f01b5f99278b295e89c2ddf0454086a7f9\"> <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/20/1426849231351/86858781-e5cf-4b78-903d-87121a53c3ab-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Dakota Johnson & Jamie Dornan in Fifty Shades Of Grey\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson in the film of Fifty Shades of Grey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Focus Features/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>EL JAMES</p> <p>FIFTY SHADES OF GREY</p> <p>Her trilogy was a breakthrough in “respectable mummy porn” – or erotic romance – featuring billionaire Christian Grey and college graduate Anastasia Steele.

It seems somehow typical that, when his novella <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/16/train-dreams-denis-johnson-review\">Train Dreams</a> became a finalist for the Pulitzer prize in 2012, the judges took one of their rare decisions to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/17/pulitzer-prize-fiction-2012-withheld\">pick no winner</a>. He is someone who leads more-famous authors to lament that he isn’t more famous: there’s a tribute from Jonathan Franzen on the cover of the latest.</p> <p>One reason that Johnson has been missed by the star-searching radar of literary publicity may be that he has failed to create a familiar brand. Train Dreams is historical fiction, but Fiskadoro post-nuclear futurism. The crime-noir novel Nobody Move and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/07/brief-history-short-survey-denis-johnson\">short stories in Jesus’ Son</a> feature drifters in America, but in 2007 Tree of Smoke left the States for an espionage story set during the Vietnam war, with echoes – in its weary middle-aged danger-chasers fighting for an increasingly dubious cause – of the fiction of Robert Stone, John Le Carré and Graham Greene.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/dec/02/fiction.features1\"> Tree of Smoke</a> was Johnson’s most substantial and successful fiction, so his admirers will forgive – and even applaud – the writer for coming, in The Laughing Monsters, as close as he ever has to repeating himself. Tree of Smoke consciously crossed some of Greene’s footprints in south-east Asia in The Quiet American, and The Laughing Monsters, especially in its Sierra Leone sections, walks in the steps of The Heart of the Matter, which was inspired by Greene’s experience of Freetown, where Johnson’s novel begins and ends.</p> <p>The time is recent: Ebola hasn’t yet reached this part of Africa – or Uganda and the Congo, to where the story moves – but other alimentary diseases are rampant, as are Aids, hostage-taking terrorists and warlords, political corruption and environmental despoilment by global mining corporations. Where other novels might note whether a particular scene takes place by day or night, The Laughing Monsters specifies whether the electrical power supply is on or off (usually it’s the latter). But these obstacles do not deter spies and missionaries from America and Europe coming in the hope of converting local souls.</p> <p>Roland Nair is in Sierra Leone for reasons that are ambiguous for most of the novel and so must remain so for the duration of this review. He claims to be a captain in the Danish army, although, as he is a rare Scandinavian with jet-black hair, we may suspect dye or, as with many characters’ claims, a lie told as part of a cover story. He seems to be in Sierra Leone (“SL” to jaded regulars) on behalf of the NIIA, one of the less-known spying acronyms, which people Nair meets assume is something to do with the CIA but apparently stands for Nato Intelligence Interoperability Architecture, a post-9/11 initiative encouraging sharing of information between allied nations. Among NIIA’s projects is the secret laying of a fibre-optic military communications system through seven west African states.</p> <p>In SL, Nair hooks up with an old associate from missions there and elsewhere: Michael Adriko, a fixer of ambiguous national affiliation but unchallengeable charisma. With Adriko in Freetown is Davidia St Clair, his latest in a chain of fiancees, who is, or says she is, the daughter of a senior American soldier. With a narrative conventionality disappointing from Johnson, Nair’s attraction to St Clair increasingly threatens the sincerity of his unsent emails (there is rarely enough electricity to power web connections) to Tina, the colleague back at spook HQ who is supposed to be his girlfriend.</p> <p>This tiresome romantic triangle thankfully occupies little of the book. The compelling majority depicts Africa through dismal Greene-like details: the night insects rattling the bug-screen to which a candle has attracted them; a Chinese TV report about panda numbers flickering on a Ugandan hotel TV; a local fixer’s car stinking of “spilt gas and dirty clothes”.</p> <p>Although the protagonist is supposedly working for Nato, Britain is stingingly peripheral to events. Introduced to Spaulding, an English agent in a bar, Nair struggles to remember the structure of the UK intelligence services: “MI 4, 5, 6?” At this point, the dialogue wobbles slightly as Spaulding says “Cheers, mate” and, challenged as being a representative of MI6, replies that he won’t have anything to do with that mob because “they’re all homosexuals”.</p> <p>The novel is possibly more up-to-date in the way that, in common with Le Carré’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/27/fiction\">A Most Wanted Man</a>, it depicts spies as the new colonialists, carving up regions between them for advantage: the American, French and British spies keep hearing Russian spoken in bars and know that, while they can’t see the Chinese, Beijing is a big player in Africa. The title neatly reflects differing cultural perspectives: an imposing range of hills, known to Africans as The Happy Mountains, were baptised The Laughing Monsters by a disillusioned missionary.</p> <p>While Nobody Move was the equal of most crime fiction, The Laughing Monsters is inferior to the very best spy novels. But this story of disguised lives should still help Johnson’s progress out of the publishing shadows.</p>","liveBloggingNow":"false","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/43xp3","wordcount":"839","thumbnail":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2014/11/3/1415022910436/Denis-Johnson-003.jpg","commentCloseDate":"2015-02-20T00:00:00+00:00","standfirst":"<p>This

railway in The Narrow Road to the Deep North","hasStoryPackage":"true","productionOffice":"AUS","body":"<p>The first Man Booker prize to allow American nominees was on Tuesday night won by an Australian, with Richard Flanagan triumphing for a “magnificent novel of love and war” that tells the harrowing stories of prisoners and captors on the Burma railway.</p> <p>Flanagan won for The Narrow Road to the Deep North as he became the third Australian to win the prize, following on from Thomas Keneally and Peter Carey.</p> <p>He instinctively hugged the Duchess of Cornwall as he received the award at a black tie dinner in London.</p> <p>“In Australia the Man Booker prize is sometimes seen as something of a chicken raffle,” he joked. “I just didn’t expect to end up the chicken.”</p> <p>The novel is an incredibly personal book for Flanagan, whose father was a survivor of Japan’s campaign to build the railway. He died aged 98 on the day Flanagan emailed his final draft to his publisher.</p> <p>“I grew up, as did my five siblings, as children of the Death Railway,” Flanagan said. “We carried many incommunicable things and I realised at a certain point … that I would have to write this book.”</p> <p>Over 12 years he wrote five drafts that he deemed deficient and burned, but he was intent on finishing before his father died.</p> <p>He stressed that the novel was not his father’s story, although he had asked him lots of questions – “the nature of mud, the smell of rotting shin bone when a tropical ulcer has opened up, what sour rice tasted like for breakfast”.</p> <p>He added: “In the end my father never asked me what the story was, he trusted me to write a book that might be true.”</p> <p>Flanagan wins £50,000, money he said would be spent on “life”, as he was not wealthy and had even, 18 months ago, considered trying to get work in the mines of northern Australia because he had spent so long on one book.</p> <p>“This prize money means I can continue to be a writer,” said Flanagan, who also worked as one of the screenwriters on Baz Luhrmann’s film Australia.</p> <p>The philosopher AC Grayling, who chaired the judges, called his book “an absolutely superb novel, a really outstanding work of literature”.</p> <p>At its heart, the book tells the excoriating, horrific story of what it was like to be a prisoner of war forced to work on what has become known as the Death Railway between Thailand and Burma.</p> <p>But the novel is about much more than that, said Grayling. “It is not really a war novel, it is not about people shooting one another and bombs going off, it is much more about people, their experience and their relationships. What’s interesting about it is that it is very nuanced, as if everyone on the Burma railway, both sides of the story, were victims.”</p> <p>It is Flanagan’s sixth novel, and although he was many people’s tip to win, he was not the bookmakers’ favourite. William Hill made him the 6/1 outsider earlier on Tuesday.</p> <p>The favourites had been the three British novelists, Howard Jacobson, Ali Smith and Neel Mukherjee, while the two Americans – Joshua Ferris and Karen Joy Fowler – were not given too much of a chance by pundits.</p> <p>Grayling said the process of reading and then re-reading twice exposed “the genuine quality in a book”.</p> <p>He added: “The best and worst of judging books is when you come across one that kicks you so hard you can’t pick up the next one on the pile for a couple of days, it delays you but you know you’ve met something extraordinary. That’s what happened in the case of this book.”</p> <p>The book’s main narrative is set in the second world war but Grayling said it also had a strong contemporary resonance given conflicts around the world.</p> <p>“With cinema and reporting we are all the more aware of the kind of trauma that people experience when they have been engaged as soldiers or bystanders in these situations,” Grayling said. “This depiction is timeless, it is not just about the second world war, it is about any war and it is about the effect on a human being.”</p> <p>It is the 46th year of the prize but the first one to allow any novel published in English to be entered.</p> <p>The change has not been universally welcomed, with many fearing the award might become dominated by American authors. On Sunday, Flanagan’s countryman Carey (twice a winner, for Oscar &amp; Lucinda and True History of the Kelly Gang) criticised the move, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/oct/14/israel-palestinian-territories-video-analysis\">saying it was “unimaginable” that America’s top literary prizes, such as the Pulitzer, would allow British and Australian authors to be nominated</a>.</p> <p>Carey, who had backed Flanagan to win, believes the “particular cultural flavour” of what was a prize for Commonwealth and Irish writers will now be lost.</p> <p>There is little prospect of the decision being changed and Grayling, on the side of allowing Americans in, said he hoped the debate could now be put to bed. “Neither the long nor the shortlist was overwhelmed by them [Americans],” he said.</p> <p>Because of the rule changes the judging panel was increased from five to six and Grayling did use his casting vote once in the nearly three-hour judging meeting, but not for final vote, said a Man Booker spokeswoman. The other judges were the academics Jonathan Bate and Sarah Churchwell, the neuroscientist Daniel Glaser, the writer and journalist Erica Wagner and former director of literature at the British Council, Alastair Niven.</p> <p>Flanagan, one of five authors on the shortlist from the Penguin Random House publishing stable, can look forward to a dramatic increase in sales.</p> <p>Jonathan Ruppin, web editor of Foyles, admitted he had been rooting for him. “It’s one of the truly great winners of the prize, one that will be widely read not least because it’s impossible to lay aside completely and forget.”</p> <p>The win be great news for one literary punter who, Ladbrokes revealed last month, visited 13 branches laying bets on Flanagan to win.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 20 October 2014 to correct the title of Peter Carey’s True History of the Kelly Gang.<br
